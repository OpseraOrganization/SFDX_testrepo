    <body>&lt;P&gt;Starting on November 09, 2012, a new value called Conditional Release will be available in the “Denied Party Status” field at the Account address level. This status will be manually set by the Customer Master team and will subsequently be used by the CSR.&amp;nbsp; The purpose of this status is to mark persons, companies, and addresses that had a potential block but the block is conditional depending on the details of the transaction.&amp;nbsp; The new “Conditional Release” status will be displayed on the “Denied Party Alert” section for Accounts and Contact.&amp;nbsp; Notes detailing the specific conditions of release will also be displayed in the “Denied Party Comments” section.&amp;nbsp; This new status won’t prevent the customer from accessing the Portal.&lt;/P&gt;</body>
