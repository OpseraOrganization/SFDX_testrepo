Dear {!Contact.Name},

Now that you are registered, we just need to validate your account with the company name that you provided. Your information will be reviewed within two business days. You will be contacted if further action is required.

Why are we doing this?
Due to our dealing with the US Government and other governments and military entities around the world, Honeywell Aerospace has compliance policies that require due diligence to ensure we are not conducting business with denied parties.
