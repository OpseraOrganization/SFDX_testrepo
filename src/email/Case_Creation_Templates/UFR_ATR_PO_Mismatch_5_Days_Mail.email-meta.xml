    <textOnly>Dear Customer,

Have you taken a look at the quote Honeywell Aerospace emailed you just a few days ago?

The reason we ask is that we haven&apos;t heard from you. And in order for us to get to work, we must have your approval. The deadline for you to accept or decline the price we quoted is five days from the date of this email, so you still have time - but please, let us know as soon as possible.

If we haven&apos;t heard from you by deadline day, we&apos;ll need to box, and return the parts uncompleted. So please, take a few minutes to review the quote information you received from us, and let us know whether or not you approve the costs and want us to get started. Once approved, your order will be released to the shop floor to be repaired. Click here to navigate to portal for Approve or Reject.

Please note that in case of no response, your unit will be automatically returned in “as is” condition (RAI) after 10 calender days.

We&apos;re looking forward to going to work for you.

If you can&apos;t locate the information we sent, or you have any questions, or if this inquiry relates to AOG please contact me directly at 1-800-601-3099 or internationally at 1-602-365-3099.

Thank you, we appreciate your business!
