    <textOnly>Thank you for contacting Honeywell Aerospace Customer Support. Your case tracking number for this inquiry is provided above. To communicate further in regards to this inquiry, please reply to this e-mail with the Reference Case # within the subject line of the message.

Please note that this is not an authorization to return product to Honeywell.

Honeywell will need the following information to evaluate your request:
· Original PO number
· Honeywell Sales Order Number
· Invoice or Shipping document number
· Part Number and Quantity
· Serial number if present
· Detailed reason for request to return
· For damaged part return requests, Honeywell requests a picture of the part and packaging

You can now create an RMA request on our new, easy to navigate Web Portal at www.MyAerospace.com. The process will guide you through all of the information required to request a Return Material Authorization.

For requests not processed with our web tool, to allow Honeywell to correctly and adequately perform trouble shooting, please download the Material Return Tag from the following link and include the completed form once Honeywell has provided a Return Material Authorization. https://www51.honeywell.com/aero/portal/Common/Documents/tag_V4.pdf.
