D&amp;S Universal Flat Rates (D&amp;S UFR)

Honeywell Aerospace launched Defense &amp; Space Universal Flat Rate pricing in 2014. Referencing the appropriate flat rate on your purchase order helps us to reduce overall repair time and gives you and the end users a tool to effectively predict, manage, and budget R&amp;O expenses.

Once Honeywell receives your funded PO, you will not be asked for further quote acceptance. Honeywell will automatically proceed with requested work scope and will send the unit back to you immediately after it is done with CAFE/Service report attached. This also applies to ‘not fault found’ units (NFF). In case of NFF you will be charged with Test Teardown and Evaluation fee (TT&amp;E) only.

Flat rate covers minor modifications, ORIs and service bulletins which do not require a change of material number. These will be incorporated without extra charges above the flat rate.


Honeywell reserves the right to reject repair materials under the flat rate program if they are deemed to have ‘excessive’ repair requirements and/or are beyond economical repair (BER).


Please note that purchase order funding has to match required work scope, otherwise repair will be held until amended purchase order is received and/or part will be returned.

All current repair and overhaul flat rates and conditions are available at Honeywell MyAerospace Portal: https://myaerospace.honeywell.com

If you have questions about Honeywell Universal Flat Rate program please contact Honeywell Customer &amp; Product Support team.
