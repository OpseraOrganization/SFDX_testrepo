A representative is working on your request. To contact us regarding this request please respond to this email. Your Case number and reference number are {!Case.CaseNumber} {!Case.Case_Ref_ID__c}



Forgive us if you’ve heard this before, but we want to make sure every customer is completely up to speed with Honeywell’s new MyAerospace.com.



The web portal gives you instant, written confirmation that your quote request has been received and is being immediately processed.



Which brings us to the second important point we want to make: One week from now, we’ll pull the plug on our email quoting system and make MyAerospace.com our exclusive online quote request vehicle.



If you haven’t already, please take a few minutes to explore MyAerospace.com, and follow the prompts to quickly and easily familiarize yourself with the system. Watch online tutorials to tap into everything this system has to offer.

In the meantime, we&apos;ll meet you at the MyAerospace.com portal.
