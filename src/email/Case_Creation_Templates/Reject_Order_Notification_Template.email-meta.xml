    <subject>Important! Honeywell Rejected Order Notification Action Required!</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear {!Case.Contact},

Reviewing the referenced purchase order submittal, we were unable to complete the entry of your order request due to missing information required for completion.  You are specifically missing the following item(s):

{!Case.Reject_Order_Reasons__c}

A new request is required and must be submitted directly to orders@honeywell.com with a complete purchase order attached. Do not reply to this or previous emails related to this order as it may disrupt proper routing.



A purchase order (PO) checklist and corresponding PO is included for your convenience. This checklist references all of the information Honeywell requires to process an order. End-user, end use, and ultimate destination are elements required on all orders to ensure proper airworthiness tag generation. Providing this information on your original submittal will minimize delays and the requirement for Honeywell to contact you for additional information.



Thank you, we appreciate your business!
