    <textOnly>Unfortunately, Aero Export Holds is not able to release this order as the appropriate license number cannot be determined.  An EXPID request must be submitted through the Compliance Portal EASE so export requirements for the order can be reviewed.  This process is required to ensure there is a record of the export request, export review and subsequent decision made by the Export Compliance Officer (ECO).

Thank you.
