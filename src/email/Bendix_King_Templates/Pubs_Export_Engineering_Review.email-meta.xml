    <textOnly>Thank you for your request for a BendixKing publication.


The manual you have requested is not available online. It is currently going through an engineering review for possible export code changes and is not available for print or purchase. We will continue to work internally with our engineering teams until this is resolved.


We apologize for any inconvenience this has caused.


Thank you,
