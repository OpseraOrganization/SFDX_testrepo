ELT Order – We Need Your Coding Sheet


Hello {!Contact.FirstName},

We&apos;re glad to hear from you! We’ve received your Emergency Locator Transmitter (ELT) order: {!Case.CaseNumber}, and are anxious to get right to work on it.

But before we can start, we need your help. We need just a bit more information to complete your request. Your ELT coding sheet.

There&apos;ve been some changes to the ELT coding sheet process since you were here last. Now, instead of emailing your sheet, you&apos;ll submit them electronically.

How to submit your ELT coding sheet.

Just log onto the portal at MyAerospace.com, select the Software &amp; Database tab, and then ASDS from the dropdown menu. Click on the &quot;Service Request Forms&quot; button to submit your information.

Accessing the new online form  does require a MyAerospace portal ID and ASDS web access. Don’t have a portal ID? No problem!

Step 1: Go to the portal and sign up as a new user. If you experience problems, notify our team at: MyAerospaceportalissue@Honeywell.com

Step 2: Once you&apos;ve received your portal account confirmation, log onto the portal, select the Software &amp; Database tab, and then ASDS from the dropdown menu. Click on the &quot;Get ASDS Access&quot; button to submit your request.  We&apos;ve included a copy of the ELT Users Guide.

If you have a portal account, but need access to the new online form?  Just follow step 2 above.

We’re no longer accepting ELT forms by email. So starting today, you’ll need to use this new form.

Questions on the ELT form?

We’ll connect all of your order details through the subject line of this email. So please leave the subject line unchanged, should you reply, to make sure your response is routed immediately to this team.

Thank you. We appreciate your business!
