Hello {!Case.Contact_Name_c},

We’re glad to hear from you, and we’re ready to go to work for you.

There’ve been some changes to the Honeywell customer quoting process since you were here last. Now, instead of emailing your request, you’ll log onto myaerospace.com &lt;https://myaerospace.honeywell.com/&gt;, and simply follow the prompts to find pricing or request a quote.

Why the change? It’s because this new system moves your request from quoted to filled to delivered faster than any email system ever could. The web portal gives you instant, written confirmation that your request has been received and is being processed. In addition, pricing on 1000’s of parts is available at your fingertips.

It’s important that you understand that in shifting to this new streamlined process Honeywell has completely disabled our email quoting system. So please, log onto MyAerospace.com &lt;https://myaerospace.honeywell.com/&gt; and resubmit your quote request.

We appreciate you taking this one-time extra step to find pricing. Rest assured, from now on out the portal will open a world of convenience, access, dependability, and speed for your company.
Thank you. We appreciate your business!
