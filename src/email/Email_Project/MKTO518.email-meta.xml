Order Status

&gt;&gt; Next time, put us to work faster by using the portal - 12 hours vs. a few seconds. That’s the difference in solution times between requesting order status by email or using Honeywell’s newly improved My Aerospace web portal! In the future, please visit www.MyAerospace.com to quickly find the status of your order, and within seconds you’ll see your conformation number, tracking data, and scheduled delivery information.

Questions

We’ve connected all of your order status details through the subject line of this email. That subject line was created specifically for you and is unique to this request.

So, please leave the subject line unchanged should you reply to make sure your response is routed immediately to this case.

Thanks again, we appreciate your business!

Best regards,
Honeywell Order Status Team
