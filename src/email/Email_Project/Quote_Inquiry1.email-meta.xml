    <textOnly>Hello {contact.firstname},



Thank you for contacting Honeywell Aerospace Customer Support.



We&apos;d like to tell you about our new quoting system that will make this process you just used a thing of the past.



Honeywell has shifted from an email-based quoting system to an easy, fast portal-based system.


But before you can submit your online quote request, you&apos;ll need to set up a portal account.


Simply log into the MyAerospace.com portal and register
as a new user. When your account is ready, you&apos;ll receive
an email confirmation to start using the system.



Questions?


Here&apos;s a quick tutorial on how to set up your portal account.



Thank you. We appreciate your business!
