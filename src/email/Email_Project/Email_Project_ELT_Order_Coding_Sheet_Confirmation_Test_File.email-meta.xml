ELT Order – We Need Your Coding Sheet


Hello {!Contact.FirstName},

We&apos;re glad to hear from you! We’ve received your Emergency Locator Transmitter (ELT) order, and are anxious to get right to work on it.

But before we can start, we need your help. We need just a bit more information to complete your request. Your ELT coding sheet.

Submitting your ELT coding sheet is super easy with the new online form. Just log into the portal at myAerospace.com, click the Software &amp; Database tab, and then select ASDS from the dropdown menu.

Accessing the new online form  does require a MyAerospace portal ID. Don’t have an ID? No problem!

Step 1: Go to the portal and sign up as a new user.

Step 2: Once you&apos;ve received your account confirmation, log into the portal and request access to the ASDS web page.

Have a portal account, but need access to the new online form?  Log into the portal and request access to the ASDS web page.

We’re no longer accepting ELT forms by email. So starting now, you’ll need to use this new form.

Questions?

We’ll connect all of your order details through the subject line of this email. So please leave the subject line unchanged, should you reply, to make sure your response is routed immediately to this team.

Thank you. We appreciate your business!
