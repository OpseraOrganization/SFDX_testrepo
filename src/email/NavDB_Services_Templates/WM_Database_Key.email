Dear 

Thank you for your email.  Your database key number will be displayed in the following location:

KLN89 and KLN94 - go to the SET 3 page on your unit

KLN90 and KLN900  go to the SET 0 page on the unit

Once you have the eight digit alpha numeric key you may proceed with the download of the database.

Please let us know if we can help any further.

Best Regards,
