    <textOnly>Dear Customer,

To make sure that you are getting the correct database for your aircraft, please use the attached DSB2015005001.  This DSB is used to determine which NavDB is appropriate for specific aircraft configuration. 

You can also find this on ADS.Honeywell.com.  Go to the bottom of the page and click on NavDB.  Then go to &quot;Flight Info&quot; then &quot;Alerts and Notices&quot;.  You will see DSB201505001-Tables to determine which NavDB is appropriate for specific aircraft configuration. 

Kind Regards,
