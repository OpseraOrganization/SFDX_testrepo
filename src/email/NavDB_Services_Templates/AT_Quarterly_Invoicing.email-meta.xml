    <textOnly>Dear Customer,
 
We are in the process of preparing your NavDB Service Renewal for cycles xxxx-xxxx. Our records indicate in the past, your company has received quarterly invoicing.

Please kindly provide documents with the government regulation that states that your company must receive quarterly invoicing. If there is no government regulation, then I regret to advise we are no longer able to offer quarterly invoicing. We can however, offer bi-annual invoicing. One invoice for 7 cycles and one invoice later in the year for the remaining 6 cycles. Please advise to allow us to proceed with your renewal.

Your prompt assistance in this matter will be greatly appreciated. Thank you.
 
 
Regards,
