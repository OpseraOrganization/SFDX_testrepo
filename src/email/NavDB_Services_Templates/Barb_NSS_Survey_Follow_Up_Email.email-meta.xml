    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

I wanted to send a quick email to say thank you for taking the time to reply to our survey.


I noticed that you asked for a follow up contact so I wanted to see if I can be of further assistance.


Please let me know if you have any additional questions or concerns and I will call you discuss your response further.


Best regards,
