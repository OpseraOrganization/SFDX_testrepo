<![CDATA[Dear Valued Customer,<br>You recently notified us that you should not have been charged tax on a&nbsp; invoice that you have received. <br><br>In order to update our billing system and remove the taxes we ask that you please send us a valid tax exempt certificate for the state in which you are exempt. The certificate must include the name and address of the company which appear on your invoice.<br><br>Once this is received it will be reviewed by our tax group and if applicable they will be able to update your account to reflect tax exempt status. We will then be able to remove the tax from the invoice.&nbsp; <br><br>In the past Honeywell had paid the required taxes, but had not billed them to our navigational database customers. A change was made in 2011 which required that we include taxes on our invoice,if applicable to the type of service and State in which you receive your database. This also may apply to web download services depending on your State.<br><br>Please feel free to contact us should you have any questions.<br><br>Thank you,<br>Navigational Database Group<br><br>email: ais.account.services@honeywell.com or nav.database@honeywell.com<br>Fax: 602-822-7333<br><br><br>]]></td>
