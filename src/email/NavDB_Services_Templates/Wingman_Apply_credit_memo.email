Hello

Customer made their purchase on Navdb invoice # a00wmxxxxx (attached).  An ACAT was created, approved, and Navdb Credit memo # a00wmxxxxx (attached) was issued.  However, the funds have never been applied back to the customers credit card.  The credit memo is showing outstanding on sap100475 account.  

Please refund the credit memo amount to the customers credit card and advise once done. 

Thank you!
