    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

Thank you for your inquiry requesting our LOA.


We do not have a Type 2 LOA,  but each database is encoded with a Product Compatibility Code This code indicates what equipment the database is compatible with.



The equipment checks this code and will only use the database if it is compatible. For example, when attempting to load a database into a KLN900, the KLN900 will verify that compatibility code of the database before accepting it.  If the compatibility code is incorrect, the KLN900 will not accept the database.


Each database contains a set of checksum values.  These checksum values are verified prior to loading a database into an avionics unit and by the self test function of the avionics unit each time it powers up to ensure the integrity of the database.  If the database file has been altered or corrupted in some way, the avionics unitâ€™s checksum test will detect this and will not use the database.


I hope this answers your question. If you need further assistance please let me know.
