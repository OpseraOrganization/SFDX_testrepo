    <subject>NavDB Renewal Important- Response Required {!Case.Case_Number__c} {!Case.Case_Ref_ID__c}</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},
We recently sent several emails regarding the renewal of your annual Navigational Database Service.
In these emails we provided you with a copy of your preliminary invoice for your review and requested your reply to confirm that you would like to renew service.
We have not heard back from you with instructions to renew or cancel service. It is important that you reply so you will continue to receive uninterrupted service.


If you did not receive the original email, we apologize and have attached the invoice here for your review.


We request that you reply to this email to advise us if you wish to continue to receive database updates. If we do not hear from you within 5 business days, we will suspend service and void the invoice.


We appreciate your cooperation with our request.


Regards,

{!Case.OwnerFirstName}
