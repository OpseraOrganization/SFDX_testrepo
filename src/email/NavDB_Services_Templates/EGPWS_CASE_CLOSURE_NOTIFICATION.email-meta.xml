    <textOnly>Dear Customer,

Thank you for your email. There are two subscription plans for you to choose from.  The first plan is the 1 update plan in which you get your single update per year and if you need another update before the year is up, it is $231 per tail number.  There is also a 6 update plan in which you still get your free update per year but then you pay $119.20 each/per tail number for the other 5 updates in the year.  This is $596 per tail number per year.  You have  xxx aircraft so if you choose the 6 update plan it would be $ xxxx.xx per year.  


Thank you,
