Hello

In order to set up a new account in SAP or edit an existing account, we need to receive a copy of the PO, letter or email from the customer where the customerâ€™s name and address can be referenced.  This supporting documentation is required by our auditors and also helps to ensure accurate account set ups.

Thanks
