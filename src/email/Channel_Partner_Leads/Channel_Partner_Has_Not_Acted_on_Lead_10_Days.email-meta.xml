    <subject>10 Day Reminder: Accept Your New Lead from the Honeywell Marketing Team</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear {!Lead.OwnerFullName},

It has been 10 days since this lead was created.


Please evaluate the lead, {!Lead.Lead_Number__c}, and update the status from marketing qualified lead (MQL) to sales accepted lead (SAL) to let us know you’re working this deal. Any leads not actioned in 10 days will be forfeited and resubmitted back to the queue.

After you update the lead status to SAL, you’re expected to update the status of the lead as it progresses using the following designations:

Sales Qualified:

o A lead that has evolved into a qualified pipeline opportunity.

· Recycle:

o Lead needs to be sent back to marketing because they are not ready to buy, but the lead needs to remain active. Requirement may arise at a future date (e.g. due mandate).

· Disqualified:

o Lead is not appropriate or viable; incorrect contact info, not our target market, lead is from a student or job seeker or customer is not interested.

· Converted:

o Lead is successfully closed and won.

Thank you for your cooperation

The Honeywell Marketing Team</textOnly>
