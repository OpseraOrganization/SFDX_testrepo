    <subject>60 Day Alert: Please Update Lead Status</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear {!Lead.OwnerFullName},

It has been 60 days since you’ve updated the status of your lead, {!Lead.Lead_Number__c}.

Please evaluate the lead and update the status from sales accepted lead using the following designations:

Sales Qualified:

A lead that has evolved into a qualified pipeline opportunity.


Recycle:

Lead needs to be sent back to marketing because they are not ready to buy, but the lead needs to remain active. Requirement may arise at a future date (e.g. due mandate).


Disqualified:

Lead is not appropriate or viable; incorrect contact info, not our target market, lead is from a student or job seeker or customer is not interested.


Converted:

Lead is successfully closed and won.


Thank you for your cooperation.

The Honeywell Marketing Team</textOnly>
