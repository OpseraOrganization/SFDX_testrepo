    <style>formalLetter</style>
    <subject>RMU EIS Alert: {!Case.Account} Aircraft: {!Case.Aircraft_Name__c} RMU: {!Case.Product__c}</subject>
    <textOnly>This notice is to inform you that {!Case.Account} has recently purchased {!Case.Product__c} for their aircraft {!Case.Aircraft_Name__c} which will be installed sometime in the near future.


If you are the CSM, {!Case.CaseNumber} has been generated and assigned to you as the owner. Please follow up with the Operator within the next 45 days to confirm when they intend to have {!Case.Product__c} installed on their aircraft and that you will contact them again within 30 days after that time to collect feedback regarding their installation experience as well as their comments on the operation of the RMU installed.

After making the initial contact and determining the anticipated installation date, please open up {!Case.CaseNumber} and update the RMU EIS Date field and set the Due Date field to 30 days after the install date. Also, don&apos;t forget to update the Contact Completed Date field with when you made contact with the operator.

If there are any follow up actions, please capture them as tasks within the case and assign to the appropriate owner (ATS, etc).
