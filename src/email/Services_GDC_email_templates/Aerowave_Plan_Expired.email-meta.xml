    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName}
You should have recently received the reminder notification shown below:

We are following up to see if you would like to update your expired plan and add additional minutes to your service. Please reply with your authorization to update the minutes and we will contact you to obtain your credit card details.

We need to hear from you by XXXXXX to avoid interruption of service. If you no longer require Aerowave service, please reply and let us know so we may take the necessary actions to update your account. Please include your {!Case.CaseNumber} when sending your reply.

As a reminder, you can use the Aerowave portal site to review your usage, view your purchase history, update your email information and view minutes/calendar thresholds for the assigned tail number.
