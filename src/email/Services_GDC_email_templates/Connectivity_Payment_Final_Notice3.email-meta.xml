    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

Although we have made multiple attempts to contact you for payment, your account remains seriously delinquent.



We are disappointed that we have not received a reply or payment from you. If you are unable to provide me with payment details we must take steps to deactivate the Connectivity service on your aircraft(s). This will impact the crew and passengers ability to work and communicate while in flight.



Payment must be received within the next 10 days to avoid cancellation of service and referral for further collections efforts. If payment has been sent please provide the date and amount paid so I can locate the funds and be sure they are applied to your account.



If you have an questions, or need more information please do not hesitate to contact me.



Thank you in advance for your immediate attention to my request.
