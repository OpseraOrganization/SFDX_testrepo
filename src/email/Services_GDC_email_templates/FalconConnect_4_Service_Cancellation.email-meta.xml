    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

Although we have made multiple attempts to contact you for payment, your account remains seriously delinquent.

We are disappointed that we have not received a reply or payment from you. Please be advised that effective MM-DD-YYYY services for the active aircraft(s) on your account have now been barred with the service provider(s). You will no longer be able to use the service or activate with another provider until payment has been received.

If payment has been sent,please provide the date and amount paid so I can locate the funds and be sure they are applied to your account.

If you have any questions, or need more information please do not hesitate to contact me.

Regards,

{!Case.OwnerFullName}
