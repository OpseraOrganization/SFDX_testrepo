    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

It has come to our attention that we have not been including VAT on the Connectivity Services invoices for {!Contact.Account_Name__c}



At this time we do not have a valid VAT number or we do not have a VAT exemption on file for your Company. To avoid having VAT fees applied to future invoices, please provide:



* VAT Number

* Company Name and Country of Registration

* VAT Exemption Letter or Certificate





You may also complete and return the attached document to me on Company letterhead so that your account information can be updated in our system.



If you have an questions, or need more information please do not hesitate to contact me.



Thank you,



{!Case.OwnerFullName}
