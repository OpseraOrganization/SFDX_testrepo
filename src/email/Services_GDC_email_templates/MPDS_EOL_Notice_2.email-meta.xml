    <subject>IMPORTANT UPDATE - End of Life Notification for Inmarsat MPDS {!Case.CaseNumber}</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear Valued Customer,
We recently sent you an email to advise that Inmarsat would be ending MPDS service by 31-Dec-2017.

We have received a second announcement from Inmarsat extending the end of life date. Please see the attached for complete details.

&quot;Inmarsat would like to announce that the MPDS service will be available until 31 March 2018 in ALL I-3 ocean regions. Since it is not feasible to migrate the MPDS service onto the I-4 satellites, the service thereafter will be available regionally, on reasonable effort basis, and will be closed in stages as we migrate each I-3 ocean region onto the corresponding I-4 satellite during the course of 2018. No MPDS service will be available beyond 2018&quot;.


If you have any questions or need further assistance please contact your Honeywell GoDirect Connectivity Sales Manager or Honeywell Area Sales Manager to discuss and identify your upgrade options to stay connected.‚Äù

Thank you for your continued business.
