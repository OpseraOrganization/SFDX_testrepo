    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

Please refer to the two prior email reminders regarding your outstanding invoice(s). As of today we still have not received payment.



We must receive payment within the next fifteen days to avoid the barring of service. Once service has been barred it will no longer be available and you will not be able to activate with another service provider until payment has been received in full.



If payment has been sent please provide the date and the amount paid so I can locate the funds and be sure they are applied to your account.



If you have an questions, or need more information please do not hesitate to contact me.



Thank you in advance for your immediate attention to my request.
