A review of your account shows that some recent invoice/s appear unpaid. We understand that oversights happen so we are sending a friendly reminder to determine when we can expect payment.



If you have not received the invoice(s) we apologize. Please forward the attached documents to your accounts payable team to begin the payment process. We would appreciate your reply with the payment details so we can be sure that it is posted correctly to your account.



We also found unapplied payments on your account. If you would like us to use these funds to apply to the open invoices please advise which amounts you would like applied and to which invoice(s):







If you have an questions, or need more information please do not hesitate to contact me.
