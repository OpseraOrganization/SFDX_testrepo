    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

I wanted to follow up on the status of payment. At this time we have not received the payment that you were processing.



Can you tell me if the payment has been made, and if so, on what date and amount? If payment has not already been sent, when to you expect it to go out.



If you have any question or need further assistance, please feel free to contact me.



Thanks in advance for your cooperation. We appreciate your continued business.
