    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

Thank you for your email requesting Honeywell submit your invoice(s) to your electronic invoice processor.


Due to the number of customers each with different requirements, we are unable to submit invoices to 3rd party payment processors.



If your chosen bill processor can accept invoices via e-mail, we will be glad to provide them with a copy.  Please provide us with

the e-mail address and future invoices will be sent directly to you and your invoice processor so they can be uploaded into their payables system.


If your processor is unable to accept an invoice via e-mail we will continue to send invoices directly to your current billing

contacts so they can be added to the processors website by you.


Just a reminder, you can also pay via Credit Card directly online by logging on to the MyAerospace portal with your Honeywell user ID and password.  We accept AMEX, MASTERCARD and VISA. If you need assistance with credit card payments you can contact us by calling 602 365-7020 Option 6.



Regards,

{!Case.OwnerFullName}
