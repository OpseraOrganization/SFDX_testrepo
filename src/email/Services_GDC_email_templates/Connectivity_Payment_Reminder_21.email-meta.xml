    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

We know that you are busy; however, I did not receive a reply to my original email so I am following up for the status of payment.



I request that you please take the time while you have this reminder in hand to reply with the payment details or send the invoices to the person or department responsible for payment.



Failure to respond or make payment may result in an interruption of service.



If payment has been made please provide the date and amount paid. If payment is in process please advise when we can expect the funds to arrive.



If you have an questions or need more information, please do not hesitate to contact me.



Thanks in advance for your cooperation. We appreciate your continued business.
