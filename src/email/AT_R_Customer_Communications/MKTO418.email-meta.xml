Dear Honeywell Customer,

Honeywell is upgrading its Aftermarket Repair &amp; Overhaul (R&amp;O) sites to an enhanced version of SAP, an enterprise resource planning system. With the upgrade, sites will now be able to see the inventory and WIP at other Honeywell locations. We’ll be able to more quickly source parts for you and fulfill requests. 

This month we successfully completed phase one at our R&amp;O sites in Tempe, Arizona; Wichita, Kansas; Basingstoke, UK; and Shanghai, China.
In October (2015), we’ll transition the following sites to the SAP solution as part of phase two. 




Tucson - North Oracle Road
11100 N. Oracle Rd
Tucson, Arizona 85737

At this time there are no changes being made to how you engage with Honeywell. Your Honeywell contacts remain the same. 

We will share more details on the timing of the transition and any specific changes over the next 60 days. 

If you have any questions or concerns, please contact your Honeywell representative or send an email to AeroCPSCommunications@Honeywell.com &lt;mailto:AeroCPSCommunications@Honeywell.com&gt;.
