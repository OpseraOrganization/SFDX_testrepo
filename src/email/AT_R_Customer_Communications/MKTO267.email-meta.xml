Spend less time looking, more time doing.

Three months. That’s how long it’s been since a lot of people in your position stopped chasing down service bulletins that have nothing to do with their aircraft.

Because for the last three months, the Honeywell Performance Accelerator has done the searching for them. It pulls up every bulletin that fits their information profile and skips any that don’t.
Log on to the Performance Accelerator &lt;http://performanceaccel.honeywell.com/&gt;, and you can customize your results by ATA chapter, efficiencies/benefits, part #, downtime, mandates – whichever format you prefer. Or, click and pull back the skin of your airframe to reveal service bulletins by system and/or location. Lighting. Brakes. Components. Avionics. Everything.





 




“This is excellent…It is informational, and it is to the point… Everything we need is at our fingertips.”
- Hillary Kipngeno (Avionics Engineer, Kenya Airlines)
