Dear Honeywell Customer,
In 2013 we announced a new partnership with Infosys to provide order management services to our
 
customers. Starting this month, we&apos;ll transition the repair and product order management services
 performed at our Tulsa, Oklahoma, facility to Infosys. 
This transition will begin on March 30th, 2015; with Infosys fully managing the Tulsa order
 management transactions on April 24th, 2015.
What this means to you:

On March 30th, 2015, customers will perform the following transactions via email or web.
 


 - For Repair and Overhaul (R&amp;O) inquiries, please use the following email address: 



 AeroRepairs@Honeywell.com &lt;mailto:AeroRepairs@honeywell.com&gt; -- for Orders, Order Status and Communications

 CPSQuoteApprovals@Honeywell.com &lt;mailto:CPSQuoteApprovals@Honeywell.com&gt; -- for all R&amp;O Quote Approvals
 




 - For Spares inquiries, please access the Honeywell portal at Myaerospace.com &lt;http://www.myaerospace.com&gt;  
 



To ensure full compliance, all associated Infosys and Honeywell employees are trained and aware of
 export compliance rules and regulations. Further, Infosys employees handling EAR restricted
 information are all United States citizens.

During this transition, we&apos;ll be conducting training and performing knowledge transfer activities
 requiring both Honeywell and Infosys CSRs to view and access customer portals. As a result, you
 may receive email notifications from both your Honeywell and Infosys CSRs through a shared
 Honeywell email account. 

Visit the Honeywell portal for online tutorial videos &lt;https://commerce.honeywell.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/HonMultimediaTutorialsCategoryCmd?storeId=10651&gt; on creating an account, placing an order, parts
 
availability and more. 
Yours Sincerely,
Honeywell Aerospace</textOnly>
