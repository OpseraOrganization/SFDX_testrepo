Dear Honeywell Customer, 
Over the past two months we’ve shared with you our plans to upgrade our SAP systems at four R&amp;O sites – Tempe, Arizona; Wichita, Kansas; Basingstoke, UK, and Shanghai, China. We are excited to say that we are on track for the Aug. 6, 2015, transition date.  
Just a quick reminder:



 



 - Starting on July 31st, 2015, at 5:00pm (MST) through Aug. 6th, Honeywell will be unable to process new or existing R&amp;O orders and product shipments. Orders received during this time will be placed in a queue for processing after Aug. 6th.
 - Orders received before and after this time frame may experience up to a two-week turnaround delay.
 - The Estimated Ship Date (ESD) function in the MyAerospace.com customer portal will not operate during this time, and will not reflect updated shipping data until the transition is complete.
 - For all Aircraft on Ground (AOG) issues, please contact the Honeywell AOG Team at 1-800-601-3099 (US/Canada) or 1-602-365-3099 (International), select phone option #4.






If you have any questions or concerns, please contact your Honeywell Customer Business Manager or send an email to AeroCPSCommunications@Honeywell.com &lt;mailto:AeroCPSCommunications@Honeywell.com&gt;.
Yours Sincerely, 

 Honeywell Aerospace</textOnly>
