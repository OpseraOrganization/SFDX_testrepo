Dear Honeywell Customer,
Last month we shared with you our plans to implement an enhanced version of SAP at four R&amp;O sites during phase one. And we promised to give you updates along the way.
Here is an update on our progress.
This first transition of the following sites is scheduled to go live August 2015: Tempe, Arizona; Wichita, Kansas; Basingstoke, UK; and Shanghai, China.
Past experience has proven that the best way to minimize order disruptions or escapes during the changeover is to designate a “freeze” period for outbound R&amp;O shipments and incoming R&amp;O orders.







Will the turnaround time or my orders be impacted?


 - Starting on July 31st, 2015, at 5:00pm (MST) through Aug. 6th, Honeywell will be unable to process new or existing R&amp;O orders and product shipments. Orders received during this time will be placed in a queue for processing after Aug. 6th.
 - We may contact you to arrange an early or later shipment if your requested delivery date falls within the one week transition.
 - Orders received before and after this time frame may experience up to a two-week turnaround delay.













Will the Honeywell document reference numbers change?


 - Honeywell documentation for work in progress (WIP) orders such as Sales Order, Notification and Quote will be assigned new reference numbers.
 - The document reference numbers prior to the changeover will no longer be visible in the MyAerospace.com customer portal. The new document reference numbers can be tracked by searching on the customer purchase order number.
 - The new document reference numbers will be available in the customer portal after the transition is completed on Aug. 6th.













Will the ship dates in the portal be updated during the transition?


 - The Estimated Ship Date (ESD) function in the MyAerospace.com customer portal will not operate during this time, and will not reflect updated shipping data until the transition is complete.













What if I have a critical need or AOG during this timeframe?


 - For all Aircraft on Ground (AOG) issues, please contact the Honeywell AOG Team at 1-800-601-3099 (US/Canada) or 1-602-365-3099 (International), select phone option #4.













What if I need to submit a warranty claim for one of these sites during the transition? 


 - For any Honeywell Aerospace warranty claims and registration requests, please send them to us at aerospacewarranty@honeywell.com &lt;mailto:aerospacewarranty@honeywell.com&gt; or use the Aerospace portal to submit your claims.






If you have any questions or concerns, please contact your Honeywell Customer Business Manager or send an email to AeroCPSCommunications@Honeywell.com &lt;mailto:AeroCPSCommunications@Honeywell.com&gt;.
Yours Sincerely, 

 Honeywell Aerospace</textOnly>
