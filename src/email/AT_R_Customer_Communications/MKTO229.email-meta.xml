Airbus Support Improvement Meeting – Frankfurt
















We hope to see you next week 
 at Airbus’ Support Improvement Meeting

Come see for yourself the new level of service we’ve built on your comments, feedback, and needs. We’ll be facilitating several key sessions, as well as gathering your thoughts and reactions to these new initiatives.

Aware of our need to improve in some areas, we have committed to increasing On-Time Delivery for avionics and mechanical repairs and spares, along with other key performance metrics.

If it’s been a while, take a look at Honeywell. Stop by our session at the Airbus Support Improvement Meeting on May 19th, or read on to learn more.
