The advantages are practically unlimited. 
 But the offer’s not.
Here’s important news from Honeywell that’s sure to be good news for you: From now until the end of the year, we’re waving the cost of upgrading to AIMS block point 17.1 on your Boeing 777 AIMS-2 equipped aircraft.
We think you’re going to like what you find in the software upgrade. It’s loaded with value-added features suggested by 777 operators, like an updated Honeywell Pilot’s Manual, kitted software media for simplified ordering, and a new level of diagnostic troubleshooting for improved field reliability. With the AIMS 17.1 upgrade, we’ll be better able to put the systems database to work for you. Precision troubleshooting to improve your field reliability.
That’s what operators said they wanted. That’s what Honeywell’s delivering.
And best of all, from now until December 31, 2015, we’re waving the cost for you.
Keep in mind, this is a limited time offer specifically for AIMS 17.1 upgrades. Other block points as well as future block points will be priced at operator net pricing on a per tail basis.</textOnly>
