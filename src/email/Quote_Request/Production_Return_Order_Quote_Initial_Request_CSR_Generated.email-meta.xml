We completed the evaluation of your production return unit (Part number: {!Case.Product_Part__c}, Serial number:{!Case.Product_Serial_Number__c}) for your PO No.{!Case.Customer_PO_RO_WONumber__c}.

To get started, we need your updated purchase order. Any PRO unit returned for rework should include a zero dollar PO with: Honeywell entity address, rework PO number, Honeywell P/N and S/N , Quantity, Bill to, Customer delivery address and Carrier and freight details.

We included the findings report and quote for your review. If you believe the report to be inaccurate, please reply to this email and we will review your claim.

If we do not receive a response within next the 10 days, we will return the unit as is to you. An invoice for evaluation and any non-recoverable time and materials required to troubleshoot your rework will be included if applicable.
