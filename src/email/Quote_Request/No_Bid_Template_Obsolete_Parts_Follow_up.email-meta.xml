    <textOnly>Honeywell has determined that this is a dormant part. This part request information has been transferred to our team managing part obsolescence. The time involved in the review process can be extensive due to the research necessary.

You are encouraged to review any alternative options available using component maintenance documentation, service and parts bulletins, or other documentation available. For Honeywell documentation please go to www.myaerospace.com.

If you have any questions or wish to follow-up, please contact your Honeywell Customer Support Manager {!Case.Customer_Support_Focal__c} or Sales Manager {!Case.Business_Focal__c}.
