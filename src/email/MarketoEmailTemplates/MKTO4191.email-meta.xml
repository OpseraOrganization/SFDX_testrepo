    <subject>Reminder: Webinar Today “Privacy in the Age of ADS-B”</subject>
    <textOnly>Date: Wednesday, February 12, 2020 – 8 pm EST

 ADS-B is here, ushering in a new world of safety and airborne services for pilots. However, this new technology brings with it a host of privacy concerns because it allows anonymous people to track and monitor your flying.
 
Join SocialFlight President, Jeff Simon, an A&amp;P/IA mechanic and builder, along with Roger Dykmann, BendixKing Director of Offering Management and Market Strategy, explore how ADS-B works, where the data goes, who has access to your information and what you can do to protect yourself and your privacy. 
 
 Topics include:


	- ADS-B Overview
	- Data You are Sharing with Every Flight
	- Where Your Data Goes
	- Who Can Access Your Flight Data
	- Ways to Protect Your Privacy
	- ADS-B Solutions
