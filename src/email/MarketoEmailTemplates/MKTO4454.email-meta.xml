Hi {{lead.First Name:default=there}},

Join Carey Miller, Honeywell’s Technical Sales Manager, and myself for an exclusive webinar discussing how business aviation operators can gain access to the FAA’s CDM program through Honeywell Forge Dispatch Services. 

 During the 30-minute session, you will learn how Honeywell Forge Dispatch Services protects against challenges that can adversely affect the productivity and efficiency of your flight department and provides significant time and cost savings. 

 From start to finish, the Honeywell Forge Dispatch team monitors the aircraft position and progress of your flight while looking ahead for weather hazards, traffic congestion, ATC delays, or any other conditions that may affect your flight. We keep you informed with proactive communications sent to your mobile device, aircraft datalink or other designated destinations.
