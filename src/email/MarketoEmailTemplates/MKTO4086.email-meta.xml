    <textOnly>Attention BendixKing Dealer: Please share this information with the appropriate maintenance and technical support personnel at your company. 

 To continue to raise awareness of BendixKing’s newest products and provide proactive technical support, BendixKing is starting a series of technical webinars with our dealer network starting December 5, 2019. These technical webinars are intended for maintenance and technical support personnel who will be installing and supporting BendixKing’s new products. The material will be focused on installation, set-up and configuration topics. 

 The first webinar will be on December 5, 2019 at 8:00 am MST and will focus on BendixKing’s AeroVue Touch KFD 900 display. 

 Future webinars will cover products such as: 
 

 	- AeroCruze 230 Autopilot 	- AeroFlight KI 300 Indicator 	- AeroNav 800/900/910 GPS Navigator 	- AeroPoint 200/300 engine monitor 

 As we gain field experience with these products, we will host follow up webinars covering tips &amp; tricks, best practices and lessons learned. We also intend to occasionally select special topics associated with our most popular legacy products.
