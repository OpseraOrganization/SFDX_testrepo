For over 70 years H+S Aviation has been supporting airlines from across Europe, the Middle East, Africa and the Far East with world-class Auxiliary Power Unit (APU) maintenance, repair and overhaul services. Airlines have come to rely on H+S to minimise the impact on aircraft availability, performance and passenger satisfaction through APU faults and failures.

Dornier, Embraer and Fokker aircraft from our state-of-the-art repair and test facility in Portsmouth UK, supported by our Field Service Teams. 

Selecting H+S Aviation as your 36-150 APU partner, brings the following valuable benefits:






	- Best-in-class turn times
	- Exchange material for urgent needs
	- Competitive pricing
