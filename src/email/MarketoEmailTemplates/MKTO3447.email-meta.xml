    <subject>Don’t Delay! Protect {{lead.Type of Platform:default=Your Aircraft}} Beyond Your Factory Warranty Through Spirit Aeronautics</subject>
    <textOnly>&lt;[[https://aerospace.honeywell.com/]]&gt; &lt;[[http://www.spiritaeronautics.com/]]&gt;

Dear {{lead.First Name:default=customer}},

Our records indicate that the factory warranty on {{lead.Aircraft Tail Number:default=your aircraft}} expires in 2019. We would like to take this opportunity to introduce you to the Honeywell Maintenance Service Plan for your aircraft.

We know you&apos;ve made a significant investment in your aircraft! An investment that deserves to be protected, which is why Honeywell developed the Maintenance Service Plan. The Honeywell Maintenance Service Plan provides owners and operators with flexible contract options and a fixed rate.

When you enroll in Honeywell&apos;s Maintenance Service Plan, you take control of your maintenance expenses and take the uncertainty out of your repair and maintenance costs. 

Contact Spirit Aeronautics, an authorized Honeywell Avionics Dealer, to discuss your maintenance needs and get a quote!
