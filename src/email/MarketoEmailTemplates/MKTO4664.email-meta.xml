    <subject>ICYMI: HAT is price matching.</subject>
    <textOnly>ICYMI (In Case You Missed It): 

 Honeywell Aerospace Trading (HAT) is launching a new Airlines Price Match Program for the entire month of August. Under this program, HAT will meet anyone’s USM price on comparable, in-stock Honeywell product. Program guidelines can be found here &lt;[[https://www.godirecttrade.com/hat-price-match?utm_source=Email&amp;utm_medium=Email&amp;utm_campaign=Price_Match]]&gt;. 

 Why you will love this program? 
 

 	- You will get quality parts from a trusted OEM. Don’t settle for less than the best. Eliminate the middleman and buy your parts directly from Honeywell.  	- There’s nothing to lose. If the competitor’s quoted price meets all the program guidelines but we choose not to match the price, you will receive a $500 online credit towards future purchases. This credit expires on 12/30/2020 and must be used on HAT’s GoDirect Trade storefront &lt;https://www.godirecttrade.com/marketplace/seller/profile/shop/HoneywellAerospaceTrading&gt;.  

 How does the program work? 
 

 	- Simply provide a valid, non-expired quote. Upon verification of the competitor quote, you will receive your Price Match Offer from HAT. 	- Applies to Honeywell used equipment only. Non-Honeywell parts are excluded. 	- Parts must be comparable and similar across a variety of aspects. Part number, model, quantity, OEM, condition, wear and tear, quality of repair tag/certification, trace, and delivery). Life limited parts and units must have comparable and similar times and cycles. Comparable / “like” quality tags should be from authorized Honeywell repair shops or Honeywell repair shops. 	- Items must be in-stock and immediately available at competing supplier. 	- Item must be purchased online through www.godirecttrade.com &lt;[[https://www.godirecttrade.com/]]&gt; in order to be eligible for the price match. 	- Full list of exclusions, limitations and guidelines on HAT’s Price Match Program can be found here &lt;[[https://www.godirecttrade.com/hat-price-match?utm_source=Email&amp;utm_medium=Email&amp;utm_campaign=Price_Match]]&gt;.
