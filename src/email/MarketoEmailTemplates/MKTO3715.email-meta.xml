Weight and Balance with Real Time Curtailment Now Available with GoDirect Flight Bag ProÂ 
 &lt;[[https://aerospace.honeywell.com/]]&gt;

Update your Honeywell Electronic Flight Bag (EFB) Pro application today to achieve the most accurate weight and balance calculations specific to your aircraft cabin and baggage compartment.



	- TAILORED: Actual aircraft cabin positions and weights are used to determine the amount of curtailment applied (dashed line)
	- PROTECTION: Computed weight and balance values are checked against and displayed within curtailed envelope
	- ACCURACY: APG curtailment protects CG integrity, always ensuring operation is within CG
	- REGULATORY COMPLIANCE: APG fixed curtailment is FAA and EASA compliant. Complies with regulatory requirement AC 120-27F (5/6/2019) applies to 14 CFR part 91K, 121, 125, and 135 operations


The new feature calculates the effect of each movement individually to determine the amount of &quot;curtailment&quot; needed and then applies this to the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) CG envelope, generating new CG Limits. Simply update to the newest app version to get started.
