Hi, {{lead.First Name:default=edit me}}
Flight Planning needn’t be time-consuming or headache-inducing. Even international flights can be made easy with the right software provider.
I’m following up on my previous note about how Honeywell Aerospace can help you save time when flight planning. My name is Maggie Deane and I’m a Sales Specialist here at Honeywell Aerospace.
At Honeywell Aerospace, our mission is to improve the lives of hard-working chief pilots.
Working with our intuitive software available on a laptop, ipad, datalink messaging, or electronic flight bag application called GoDirect Flight Bag Pro, we break down even the longest international flights into straight-forward processes.
As the first and only provider to integrate flight planning with multiple flight scheduling software systems, let us help save you time spent preparing and filing flight plans &lt;[[https://aerospace.honeywell.com/en/services/aerospace-services/flight-planning?utm_source=email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=19_godirectflight_bga&amp;utm_term=email2]]&gt;.
Do you have 15 minutes this week so I can explain exactly how it works?
Dedicated to your success,

Maggie Deane
