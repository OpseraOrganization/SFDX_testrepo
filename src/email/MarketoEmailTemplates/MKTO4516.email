<span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;">Hi&nbsp;{{lead.First Name:default=there}}, </span>
<br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;"> Recently, one of my team members tried to reach you to talk to you about your Laseref II or III that is no longer supported by Honeywell or our MSP Avionics plan. Unfortunately, we weren’t able to reach you so I’m following up. </span>
<br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;"> In December, we stopped supporting older versions of our Laseref systems to be able to provide the highest level of customer service and product support for customers using our Laseref IV. </span>
<br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;"> Because your aircraft is currently equipped with a system we no longer support, I’d like to connect with you to help you better understand how you can upgrade to Laseref IV while there’s still trade-in incentives. </span>
<br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;"> Is there a day/time that works best for you for us to connect? </span>
<br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;"> I look forward to hearing from you. </span>
<br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;"> Sincerely, </span>
<br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;"> Kathy Tyler</span>
