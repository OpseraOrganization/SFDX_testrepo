Thank you for being a Honeywell Channel Partner. Over the last two years, Honeywell&apos;s Channel Partner program has undergone a number of changes. We would appreciate it if you could take a few minutes to share your thoughts and feedback via a brief, anonymous survey by Tuesday, April 16, 2019.

The survey is intended for individuals familiar with the channel partner relationship. If you are receiving this email and are not involved in the management of the channel partner program with Honeywell, please disregard or forward to the appropriate person within your organization.
