    <subject>Benefits of Honeywell’s LASEREF IV Inertial Reference System</subject>
    <textOnly>Honeywell’s LASEREF family has been the standard for the commercial aerospace market segment since the entry into service in 1997. The LASEREF series continues this innovative tradition, with the new LASEREF IV, that provides exceptionally long life in inertial reference systems (IRS) with stable performance over the entire range of Aerospace environments.

 The LASEREF IV upgrade has many benefits compared to the aging LASEREF II’s and III’s IRS:



	- 25 pounds lighter than LASEREF II

	- 10 pounds lighter than LASEREF III
	- MTBF (Mean Time Between Failures) consistently exceeds 40,000 hours
	- Automatic re-align function for post-flights alignments especially suited for quick turns


For a limited time, Honeywell and Clay Lacy are offering attractive promotional pricing and trade-in credit.  For each LASEREF IV ordered, receive a trade-in credit with the return of each LASEREF II and LASEREF III unit.
