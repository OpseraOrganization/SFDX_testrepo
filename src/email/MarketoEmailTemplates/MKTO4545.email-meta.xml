    <subject>Thinking about downtime during downtime</subject>
    <textOnly>Hello again,

Right now, while the entire world experiences unprecedented downtime and experts across the board are giving us new ways to think and continue to move forward, we all look to what could be a changed future. However, we know that your business will progress, and we want you to know that we’re here to help you make it happen. 

We understand that nothing is more important than the safety of {{lead.ABM Company Name}} employees—and safety is top of mind when your employees fly on company planes.

While aircraft are experiencing downtime, many people see this as an opportune time to think about and schedule upgrades. As we prepare for tomorrow, this could be the time to make changes that can improve the flight experience for yourself, your employees and your pilots.

So while you and your planes are in the air less frequently, or not at all, you might consider learning about new technologies for the best use of time in the air. Our “Time Is Critical” e-book collection focuses on evolving technologies that help you do that.

We hope to see you in the air soon!

With warm regards,
