    <textOnly>Hello {{lead.First Name:default=Friend}},

While equipment is idle, it may be the ideal time to bring new levels of control to your organization&apos;s flight experience.

Many people are seeing this as an opportunity to think about and schedule needed upgrades to increase security, reliability and quality. Pilots could have the ability to make more informed choices, and passengers could have the ability to make better use of their time spent in the air. Honeywellâ€™s JetWave satellite communications system is the most reliable connectivity available in the skies and provides customization seat by seat and flight by flight. Our flight display options provide greater visual representation and live information to address challenges in the air and on the ground.

Controlling the flight experience means managing opportunities to be more comfortable, productive, safe and cost efficient. Our flight experience assessments will take a close look at improvements you can make right away in connectivity, situational awareness and navigation systems.
