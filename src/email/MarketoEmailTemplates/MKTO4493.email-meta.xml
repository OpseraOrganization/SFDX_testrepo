In today’s environment, we understand that general aviation pilots are looking to save money and get the most out of their current avionics. 

 Transitioning from flight planning to navigation has never been easier. In this webinar, we’ll show you tips and tricks to seamless integration of flight planning on Foreflight and your AeroNav navigators. Then, take to the skies and multiply your panel glass with direct Wi-Fi control from your iPads. 

 By the end of the webinar, you’ll have mastered these simple steps to integrated flying:



	- Pre-plan your flight using Foreflight
	- Wi-Fi flight plan upload to the AeroNav GPS navigator
	- Inflight screen sharing using the IFD100 App to double or even triple the number of AeroNav screens
	- Strategic flight re-planning en route and direct upload to AeroNav


As you get back to flying you can have an even better experience in flight simply by using your AeroNav GPS navigator &lt;[[https://www.bendixking.com/en/products/nc/navigation-and-communication/aeronav]]&gt; to its full potential.
