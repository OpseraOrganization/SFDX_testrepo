    <subject>Reminder to take this HON survey.  Help us prioritize estimated ship date improvements.</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear {{lead.First Name:default=edit me}} {{lead.Last Name:default=edit me}},

 

Earlier this week we sent you a survey invite. But we haven&apos;t heard from you yet. The survey closes next Tuesday (1/13) and we don&apos;t want to start making changes without your feedback! 

As a reminder, here&apos;s what we&apos;re measuring:

We&apos;re working to improve our estimated ship data and notifications process for repair and overhaul customers. We would like to include your opinions to help guide those efforts.  

We’ve hired an independent market research firm, Lynx Research, to conduct an online survey.  If you qualify and complete the full survey, you will receive a gift card for the amount of $25 USD, as a token of our appreciation. You will have the option to “opt out” of the incentive at the end of the survey should your company policy disallow incentives. 

Click on the link below today, as you only have until Tuesday, January 13th. Our team is already in place to begin making changes, so don&apos;t miss this chance to direct our efforts. Your voice matters! 

To complete the survey, simply click on the link below, or copy the entire web address into the address bar of your web browser.  Please make sure you copy the whole link.

Please be assured that no one will attempt to sell you anything as a result of participating in this survey.  The findings will be used for research purposes only, and the identities of the participants will be kept completely confidential. If you have any questions, please email Lori Goodman at LGoodman@lynxresearch.net &lt;mailto:LGoodman@lynxresearch.net&gt;

Thank you in advance for completing our survey. 

Sincerely,

The Honeywell Customer Experience Team</textOnly>
