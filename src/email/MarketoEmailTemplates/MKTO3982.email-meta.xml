    <subject>B737NG Parts for Sale from Honeywell Aerospace Trading’s Latest Acquired Aircraft</subject>
    <textOnly>&lt;[[https://aerospace.honeywell.com/]]&gt; 
 &lt;[[https://aerospace.honeywell.com/]]&gt;

Honeywell Aerospace Trading has acquired a Boeing 737-700 aircraft for teardown. WestJet Airlines operated the aircraft for the entirety of its serviceable life, and it was their first 737NG. The disassembly of this aircraft, MSN 32404 with a 2001 date of manufacture, has commenced in Goodyear, Arizona, USA. 
 
 HAT continues to expand our support of the 737NG product line with this strategic acquisition, enabling us to provide complete inventory support for 737NG customers. 
 
 Removed components will be fully re-certified and available for sale or exchange from the Honeywell Distribution Center in Phoenix, Arizona. Components will also be available for immediate purchase from HAT’s storefront on GoDirect Trade. A number of items will be available in As-Removed condition. 
 
 HAT is a growing provider of used serviceable material to aircraft operators and maintenance, repair and overhaul facilities worldwide via our global sales force and stocking locations in Europe, North America and the Asia-Pacific region.
