From Deserts to Oceans and in Between, You’re ‘Still Connected’
&lt;[[https://youtu.be/Pnt-nZsVsqs]]&gt;
Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Customer}},
Is there anything more annoying – on the ground or in the air – than not having a Wi-Fi signal or worse, one that constantly drops your connection? You deserve much better after a hectic day of work, traffic, kids, housework, and busy airport security lines. With Honeywell’s JetWave and Inmarsat’s GX Aviation service, gone are the days of the Wi-Fi Dead Zone. Our high-speed Wi-Fi network, delivered from satellites that cover the globe with a constant connection – even over oceans – ensures a “still connected” experience at 30,000 feet. So, worry no more, Honeywell and Inmarsat literally have you covered.  






READY TO GET CONNECTED? &lt;[[https://aerospace.honeywell.com/en/pages/Honeywell-JetWave-Provides-High-Speed-Connectivity-Globally]]&gt;</textOnly>
