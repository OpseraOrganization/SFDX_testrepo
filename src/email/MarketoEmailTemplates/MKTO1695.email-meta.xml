Dear Customer,


ADS-B MANDATES ARE FAST APPROACHING.
By 2020, all aircraft operating in the U.S and Europe* will be required to transmit ADS-B positioning information in compliance with DO-260B - the deadline is January 2020 for US airspace, June 2020 for European.
Do you have a crystal-clear plan for securing the required hardware and upgrading your fleet in time to comply with these mandates? If not, Honeywell and AMAC Aerospace can help. We have a variety of DO-260B-compliant solutions available now.
TALK TO OUR SPECIALISTS TODAY AND DEVELOP YOUR 2020 VISION.
