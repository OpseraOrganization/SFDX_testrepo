    <subject>Quality protection &amp; predictable maintenance costs for your HTF Nacelle</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Customer}}, 

 As a long-standing customer in our MSP Engine program, we appreciate your business and support over the years. In December of 2020, we launched the MSP Nacelle program &lt;[[https://aerospace.honeywell.com/en/pages/htf7000-nacelle-coverage]]&gt; for GulfstreamÂ G280 operators. 

Gulfstream G280 operators can now benefit from additional maintenance coverage for the nacelle system to reduce downtime, limit unexpected repair costs and gain control over maintenance needs and budgets. MSP HTF Nacelle comes packed with features that include routine inspections, treatment and repair of corrosion, and/or replacement of nacelle components when Beyond Economic Repair (BER).

 Coupled with our simple-to-understand MSP Engines program, award-winning Honeywell customer service, and the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) brand, the MSP HTF Nacelle is a comprehensive 
solution and ideal choice for your Honeywell propulsion system.

Read the MSP HTF Nacelle brochure &lt;[[https://pages3.honeywell.com/rs/641-QIX-912/images/MSP-Nacelle-Brochure_Honeywell2020.pdf]]&gt;, where you can read more about the program features and benefits and view a comparison of program tiers.

Honeywell MSP Sales Manager for more details or to enroll in MSP HFT Nacelle today.
