    <subject>Great Routers Come in Small Packages</subject>

Honeywell’s GoDirect Router is everything you need to stay connected – and less. 

With this new innovation, we reinvented the airborne router – slashing size, weight and power consumption – without sacrificing any of the speed, performance or reliability you need to get connected and stay connected. Did we mention it costs 70% less than comparable routers? 

But even those impressive figures don’t fully describe all the ways the GoDirect Router can improve the Wi-Fi on your business jet, turboprop or helicopter. Its compact size and low cost make the GoDirect Router the perfect choice when you want to install more than one to create a distributed network on your aircraft. 

It’s easy to use multiple routers to eliminate dead zones and deliver the true nose-to-tail Wi-Fi connectivity your passengers and flight crews crave. 

Give them what they really want: A seamless Wi-Fi experience to stay productive and entertained from wheels-up to wheels-down with the first router worthy of the GoDirect name.
