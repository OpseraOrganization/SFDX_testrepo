Only you can help us win this one.
You’re the one who’ll get to know your contact and exactly what they need to succeed. You’ll be the person checking in to see how it’s going, emailing news and articles that’ll help them do their business better, sending them a card that’ll give ‘em a big laugh on their birthday.


If you haven’t yet, do it now!
Everything you need to know about the required SFDC tasks assigned to you is in the communication the Customer Experience Team sent you last Tuesday. (To save you the hassle of trying to find it, we’ve reattached the training materials.) Those activities are your responsibility, so PLEASE take the time to read and understand them in SFDC.
Only three days before we change the Honeywell customer experience forever!
Get up to speed. And let’s get ready to win.
