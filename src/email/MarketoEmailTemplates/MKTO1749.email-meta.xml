The last place I expect to be able to make a video call is at 20,000 feet. &lt;[[https://www.cnet.com/news/in-flight-wi-fi-fast-honeywell-connected-plane/]]&gt;



If you’re frustrated by the slow internet connections you get while flying, here’s good news: New technology could soon bring much faster Wi-Fi to commercial planes.  &lt;[[http://www.today.com/video/watch-today-try-out-better-wi-fi-in-the-sky-live-at-25-000-feet-963763267922]]&gt;





It was possible to stream YouTube and Netflix simultaneously while downloading a large file at 2MB — all without interruption. &lt;[[https://skift.com/2017/06/02/honeywell-shows-off-connected-aircraft-capabilities-on-test-flights/]]&gt;
