Honeywell turned to the experts to develop an all-new take on the electronic flight bag (EFB). The GoDirect Flight Bag Pro was designed by professional pilots, for professional pilots. So it’s got all the features you need in an EFB and none that you don’t.

For starters, GoDirect Flight Bag Pro puts the enormous power of our advanced GoDirect Flight Planning engine at your fingertips. You can use your tablet to view available routes and create, optimize and file a flight plan in just minutes. 

You also can use our EFB to calculate and compare aircraft-specific cruise modes, download trip kits and Jeppesen charts, access real-time weather updates and GPS position data, view airport approach plates – and much more. 

GoDirect Flight Bag Pro is a real time saver and a great way to reduce pilot workload and improve operational performance. But what else would you expect from an EFB designed by pilots, for pilots? 

If you’re looking for the ultimate electronic flight bag – look no further. GoDirect Flight Bag Pro from Honeywell changes the game
