 The world is facing an unprecedented challenge from COVID-19 and during this crisis we wanted to reach out to let you know we are with you in the fight against the pandemic. 
 
 We understand that you, our valued customers, are facing a variety of complex and fast moving challenges at this time. As a result, we continue to monitor the global impact of the crisis and are complying with all official bodies and directives.

 During these difficult times, we hope that you, your family, your colleagues and employees are well. This crisis brings us all together in a united effort to combat the effects of COVID-19 on our communities, no matter where are in the world. As always, we very much appreciate your business and understanding in this rapidly shifting environment.
