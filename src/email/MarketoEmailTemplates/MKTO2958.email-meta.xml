    <subject>Turn Your Write-offs Into Takeoffs: New Tax Perk for Aircraft Upgrades</subject>

Turn Your Tax Write-offs Into Takeoffs – New Tax Incentive Aids Buying and Upgrading Your Corporate Aircraft

If you or your company pay United States taxes, this message is for you: Did you know that new U.S. tax rules allow you to tax write-off up to 100 percent of business aircraft and related equipment purchased by your company, no matter whether they&apos;re new or used? 

The changes are part of tax code changes approved last year. Previously, newly purchased aircraft could only receive up to a 50 percent deduction, and upgrading or buying used aircraft had fewer immediate benefits. 

The revised code means now is the perfect time to add Honeywell&apos;s JetWave high-speed Wi-fi to make your flight time more productive. Or ensure you can fly when you want by adding new Honeywell weather radars and avionics to the cockpit. Or lower your operating costs by upgrading your engine and mechanical components with Connected Maintenance technology.

Want to know more about the tax changes and how they can work for you? Click below and we&apos;ll connect you with one of our product experts. Or come
