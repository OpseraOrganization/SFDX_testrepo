Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Customer}}, 
 
 
 
 
 It’s no secret that streaming videos, downloading large files and watching live TV on an aircraft requires rock-solid Wi-Fi. But what enables that connectivity and how is it optimized? 
 
The unsung hero behind every gigabyte you download is your router. And if you aren’t using the right device, you aren’t optimizing the full potential of your network. Cue Honeywell’s new GoDirect Router &lt;[[https://aerospace.honeywell.com/en/blogs/2018/march/great-airborne-routers-come-in-small-packages]]&gt; – the latest smart technology that maximizes bandwidth so you get the most out of your connectivity.  
 
Now  65% smaller, 45% lighter, 35% less power consumption and 70% lower cost compared to other comparable routers in the market today. The only thing big is its performance. 
 
Learn how the GoDirect Router paired with GoDirect Cabin &lt;[[https://aerospace.honeywell.com/en/service-listing/godirect-cabin]]&gt; services can increase performance and save you money today!
