    <textOnly>CUSTOMER UPDATES AND NOTIFICATIONS
Dear Valued Customer, 

 Starting on December 1, 2020, Gogo will be invoicing your aircraft for monthly Iridium Voice and Short Burst Data services. During this transition, there will be no interruption in your service. Gogo will be reaching out to you directly to sign an updated service agreement and confirm your monthly service plan selection. We are here to help you every step of the way through this transition. The final bill from Honeywell Forge will be delivered near December 15.

 HOW DOES THIS IMPACT MY EXPERIENCE?


	- The Iridium phone number to the aircraft will not change.
	- Gogo will begin billing directly for Iridium Voice and Short Burst Data services.
