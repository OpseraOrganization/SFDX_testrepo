    <subject>Your Repair and Overhaul Quote Form is Changing</subject>
    <textOnly>&lt;[[https://aerospace.honeywell.com/]]&gt;
Dear Customer:  Reviewing and approving repair and overhaul (R&amp;O) quotes from Honeywell just got easier. We are making enhancements to our quote form and process that will simplify and clarify your R&amp;O experience.    New enhancements include:   
 	- More specific repair breakdown information for better decision-making, 	- Obsolete and non-repairable information,  	- Expanded warranty section to allow more space for warranty comments,  	- Standardized and simple quote format,  	- Direct links for quote approval on MyAerospace,  	- Reference-only quotes clearly marked as “FYI Quote: No Action Required”,  
	- More details including: ORI and Service Bulletin incorporation details, reason for re-quote, identification of CID/FOD/mishandling, recurrent/low-time failures, and warranty period, where applicable, and 	- Quote alignment to the Honeywell entity that provides your invoice. 
 
These updates will be incorporated on March 4, 2019.   Our goal is to make it easier do business with us. For questions or feedback, please contact us &lt;[[https://myaerospace.honeywell.com/contact-us/forms/website-issues/website-feedback]]&gt;.

 
 
 
 
 
 Sincerely,

 
 
 Honeywell Aerospace
