The DU-875 display upgrade is a form-fit, plug-n-play upgrade that offers increased reliability, reduced cost of ownership, reduced weight that translates to fuel savings and a growth plan that takes advantage of future technologies and applications. Score all of these benefits without changing the existing wiring or requiring additional pilot training.
