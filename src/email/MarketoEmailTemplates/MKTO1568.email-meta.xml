    <subject>New enhancements from Honeywell MyAerospace.com</subject>
    <textOnly>Coming Soon! 
We are making it even easier to register for MyAerospace.com. We&apos;ve collected customer
feedback and we are making major improvements to our website!
 
 
 
Registration is Even Easier
 
You are still registered for the same applications, but we simplified how you get
access to the new ones.
Application tiles now show if you have access.
You can request access directly from the Home Page.
 
Personalized Home Page Experience
 
We are customizing your home page based on your company profile; because of this, your app tiles
may be different from your previous settings. 
You can adjust the application tiles you use on a daily basis by clicking on &apos;Customize These Applications&apos;.
 
We are updating our recordsâ€¦
Please note that when you login to MyAerospace portal you may be asked to enter your contact
information to keep our records updated.</textOnly>
