Dear Customer, 

When it comes to getting answers to your technical questions, the Honeywell Aerospace Technical Support network is available 24/7 to take your call or email. But when calling or email isn&apos;t convenient, you now have another option in your search for technical solutions: on your own schedule, any time of the day or night. 

The new online Technical Support web site allows you to search for technical solutions, view &quot;how-to&quot; videos, and access useful tools and information on a wide range of technical subjects relevant to your equipment. You also have access to tech tips, and can view your company’s technical inquiries currently in work.  If you&apos;re not finding what you need, simply submit a new technical inquiry or question online without leaving the site, or click Chat to speak with a technical support engineer. 

Technical solutions continue to be added to the knowledge management database every day to ensure you have access to the best possible online technical support information available. 

To learn more about the online technical support site, we invite you to watch this brief 3-minute presentation &lt;http://Ez.com/ATSSSNov2014YT&gt;.  Then log in through the customer portal &lt;https://myaerospace.honeywell.com/wps/portal/&gt;, and click on the “Technical Self-Service” button to get started.

Thank you,

Aerospace Technical Support
