Partnering for success in the recovery – A message from the Vice President of Airlines APAC, Andrew Wong


 


&quot;The pandemic has led to a significant impact on aviation industry and many of us have had pivoted our resources to continue our operation with maximum cost efficiency. A reduction in flight hours has resulted in some parked aircraft in the past year and in some cases has expedited the fleet retirement plan. However, we all hope that there is light at the end of the tunnel as vaccination programs begin and progress in many countries and international travel soon resumes. In anticipation of flying activities gradually increasing, Honeywell is committed to support operators to prepare aircraft for re-entry into service efficiently. Our customer core teams are always ready to listen to your operational needs and would love to discuss on the solutions that would help to minimize cost of returning aircraft to services, as well as to optimize your operation cost. Please do not hesitate to talk to us and share with us your operating plans. We look forward to be your valuable partner, working hand in hand to assist you in achieving maximum operational efficiency and cost savings during this challenging period.&quot;
