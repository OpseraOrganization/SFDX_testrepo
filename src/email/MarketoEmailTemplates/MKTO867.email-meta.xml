Honeywell is Going To Green.



You know the drill. Every year, Airbus surveys their airlines to find out how we at Honeywell are doing.

 To Airbus’ business credit, they won’t accept anything very far from perfect. If any customer rates our performance as a 1 or 2 on a scale of 5, they want to know the reasons why.

 And we do too. As we reviewed during the webinar, you and every Honeywell customer service rep can now find Airbus ratings in SFDC, by airline. A feedback form was created for each airline. 
As a reminder, here&apos;s how to find the feedback form for your airline and what happens next. 


Finding the feedback:
1.  Watch the 2-minute instructional video &lt;[[https://corpapp.honeywell.com/sites/honvideo/Pages/Player.aspx?bctid=4787065515001&amp;UsrId=e045068&amp;ItmId=5738]]&gt;

2.  Log into Salesforce &lt;[[https://login.salesforce.com/?ec=302&amp;startURL=%2F00O13000008Zo9C]]&gt; and review your airline participants&apos; feedback record.
Here&apos;s what&apos;s coming:
3.  Next week the Go to Green Plans (GGPs) will be launched, and you&apos;ll receive an email notification 
     when they&apos;re loaded.
4.  You will begin calling the survey takers about their specific scores.
5.  You will need to action the GGPs per the instructions in the instructional video &lt;[[https://corpapp.honeywell.com/sites/honvideo/Pages/Player.aspx?bctid=4787065515001&amp;UsrId=e045068&amp;ItmId=5738]]&gt;.
I will provide weekly GGP completions stats to the leadership team and those on copy.
Thank you for your support,
