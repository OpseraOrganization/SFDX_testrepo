In our latest update for GoDirect™ Flight Bag Pro &lt;[[https://aerospace.honeywell.com/en/services/aerospace-services/godirect%E2%84%A2-flight-bag-pro]]&gt;, you can get a better strategic view of your flight path with our new, three-dimensional vertical situation display (VSD). Easily turn on Icing and turbulence weather overlays to help avoid nasty weather while flying your route!

Also included in this update is a new airport WX overlay that allows you to view airport METAR information on the map for all global airports.

We hope you find these additions helpful when planning and flying your next trip.

Thank you,

The Honeywell GoDirect Team
