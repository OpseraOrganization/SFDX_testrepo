    <subject>Elevate your aircraft’s inertial system to LASEREF IV</subject>
    <textOnly>Make avionics obsolescence a thing of the past by giving your aircraft’s inertial reference system a fresh boost. Upgrade to LASEREF IV – the latest version of the Honeywell family of inertial systems – and benefit from increased efficiency, performance and reliability.

 The LASEREF IV upgrade in collaboration with Pentastar Aviation is the ideal replacement for the LASEREF II or III. Our latest retrofit solution delivers the lowest cost of ownership for inertial reference systems and offers you a 30% improvement in reliability than its previous versions. 

 Plus, throughout 2021, you get $26,250.00 credit towards upgrading to LASEREF IV when you trade in your aging LASEREF II or III.

 Contact Pentastar Aviation to find out more on how to upgrade to LASEREF IV and take your aircraft’s inertial reference system to the next level.
