SIMPLIFYING OUR PHOENIX DISTRIBUTION PROCESS
Dear Honeywell Customer,
In order to streamline and improve our delivery performance to you, we are consolidating our distribution centers in the Phoenix, Arizona area to one facility.  

From March 15, 2017, Honeywell will begin to transition and ship parts from our new distribution center:  

 	-   Honeywell Distribution Center:   1720 E. Grant Street,  Phoenix, AZ 85034   

 
 Our consolidated facility has a fully approved quality management system for this work and is approved by the FAA to ship to the aftermarket.  
 
 Please ensure your receiving, procurement, finance department have this new address in their database to allow proper receipt and processing, preventing any delays at your receiving site.  
 

Please retain previous address in order to continue receiving during transition period. 

We are confident this consolidation will help us be more efficient and responsive to you.  

Thank you for your business.
