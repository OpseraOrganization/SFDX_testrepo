Would you watch this at home? No! So why would you trust it in the air?  Clear up your view of the sky with the latest LCD technology by upgrading to the Primus 
Elite DU-875 display with Mid Canada Mod Center. 

The DU-875 is more than a display upgrade - it’s a new avionics system. While initially designed to overcome upcoming CRT DU-870 obsolescence, DU-875 delivers enhanced flight management tools, future growth capability, improved reliability, and reduced cost of ownership by being lighter, translating to fuel savings. And the best part? The DU-875 upgrade does not require additional pilot training or modifications to the cockpit.

Upgrade one or all of your displays today and take advantage of a trade-in credit of $35,000 for each DU-870 unit (no limit). This trade in offer is only good through 6/30/19 so don’t delay!
