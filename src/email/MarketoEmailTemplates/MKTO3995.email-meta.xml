    <subject>An NBAA Invitation from Racing Champion Brad Keselowski</subject>
    <textOnly>&lt;[[https://aerospace.honeywell.com/]]&gt;

Hello,

I’m Brad Keselowski, championship NASCAR driver and business entrepreneur — both of which require a demanding travel schedule. This is why I own a business jet and fly the country with my chief pilot Joey Meier.

So when it was time to decide whether I should buy a new plane, Joey and I considered all the options for Checkered Flag Aviation. 

In the end I thought, &quot;Why would I buy a 
new airplane when the one I have completely fulfills the mission?&quot; It made more sense to upgrade the one I have.

Joey and I invite you to learn why upgrading with Primus Elite made perfect business sense for me, and how this state-of-the-art cockpit makes Joey&apos;s piloting easier and safer. 

Program: &quot;Learn How Checkered Flag Aviation Wins with Primus Elite&quot;
Where: NBAA – Las Vegas Convention Center, Room #N256
Date: October 22, 2019
Time: 2:00 p.m. – 3:00 p.m.

I hope to see you there!

Brad Keselowski
Two-time NASCAR Champion
