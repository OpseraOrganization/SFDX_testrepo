    <textOnly>Greetings, {{lead.First Name:default=}} 

 I’m thrilled to invite you to the 2020 Honeywell Customer Advisory Board meeting here in Phoenix March 10, 2020. Since our last board meeting, our team has been hard at work designing, developing and releasing software, applications and hardware based on your feedback. We are now turning our focus to the next generation of cabin connectivity and believe your experience and input will help us shape and prioritize these solutions. 

 We have revised roadmaps and demonstrations we are excited to share with you along with a first look at new technology you helped develop. We will have a packed agenda again and hope you can make the meeting.
