    <subject>LASEREF IV Retrofit with Honeywell and Pro Star Aviation!</subject>
    <textOnly>Now is the time to upgrade to business aviation’s best inertial reference system—Honeywell’s LASEREF IV—the perfect replacement for your older LASEREF II or LASEREF III system. Honeywell announced end of life on these products starting December 31, 2019. Don’t get caught with an AOG situation. 
 
 The LASEREF IV represents a significant advancement in inertial reference system technology. It offers a 30% improvement in reliability, 35% weight reduction, uses considerably less power and has the lowest cost of ownership of any IRS flying today!
Honeywell and Pro Star are also offering a special offer—for each LASEREF IV ordered, receive a trade-in credit with the return of each LASEREF II and LASEREF III unit.
Contact Pro Star Aviation, our authorized dealer, and schedule your upgrade now.
