Frustrated by failures and exchange costs on your DU-870 displays? Stop supporting 
your aircraft with spares that have a limited life span. Instead, improve your vision and add instant value to your aircraft by upgrading to Honeywell Primus Elite DU-875 LCD displays with StandardAero. Benefits of upgrading include:



	- Updates cockpit to the latest technology with a quick &quot;plug and play&quot; display
	- Removes obsolescence issue facing DU-870 CRTs 
	- Lowers your cost of operation - increases reliability by 2X and lowers weight by seven pounds per display unit
	- Brings a brighter, clearer, high-resolution picture to the pilots that runs cooler and creates less heat in the cockpit
	- Operators can replace display units one at a time upon failure or all displays at once
	- Positions aircraft to later add operational features as part of the Primus Elite upgrade such as electronic charts, advanced maps, maintenance pages, optional Weather XM® information, and even 
Synthetic Vision (SVS). 


Plus, when you upgrade one or all of your displays you can take advantage of a limited-time $35,000 trade-in credit per DU-870 display unit (no limit) through 6/30/2019. To sweeten the deal, StandardAero is also offering customers an additional $5,000 savings to customers on top of Honeywell trade-in credits! 

Don&apos;t delay! Contact StandardAero to learn more or request a quote.
