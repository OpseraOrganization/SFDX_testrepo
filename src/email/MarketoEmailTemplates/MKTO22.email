<p><span>Dear <span>{{lead.First Name:default=edit me}} {{lead.Last Name:default=edit me}},</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Earlier this week we sent you a survey invite. But we haven't heard from you yet. The survey closes next Tuesday (1/13) and we don't want to start making changes without your feedback!</span></p>
<p><span>As a reminder, here's what we're measuring:</span></p>
<p><span>We're working to improve our estimated ship date and notifications process for repair and overhaul customers. We would like to include your opinions to help guide those efforts.</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>We&rsquo;ve hired an independent market research firm, Lynx Research, to conduct an online survey.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Click on the link below today, as you only have until <strong>Tuesday, January 13th</strong>. Our team is already in place to begin making changes, so don't miss this chance to direct our efforts. Your voice matters!</span></p>
<p><span>To complete the survey, simply click on the link below, or copy the entire web address into the address bar of your web browser.&nbsp; Please make sure you copy the whole link.</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>URL: </span>{{lead.Survey Link:default=edit me}}</p>
<p><span>Please be assured that no one will attempt to sell you anything as a result of participating in this survey.&nbsp; The findings will be used for research purposes only, and the identities of the participants will be kept completely confidential. If you have any questions, please email Lori Goodman at </span><a href="mailto:LGoodman@lynxresearch.net"><span>LGoodman@lynxresearch.net</span></a><strike><u></u></strike></p>
<p>Thank you in advance for completing our survey.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Sincerely,</span></p>
<p>The Honeywell Customer Experience Team</p></div>
