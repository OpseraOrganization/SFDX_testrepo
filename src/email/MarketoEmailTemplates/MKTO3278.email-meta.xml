Yes, it is 2018 so why should you still have to manually upload and download anything? Honeywell’s latest Aircraft Data Gateway (ADG300) &lt;[[https://aerospace.honeywell.com/en/services/aerospace-services/aircraft-data-gateway]]&gt; gives airlines an affordable and flexible way to wirelessly transfer data on and off their aircraft in real time from anywhere.

Designed specifically for airlines, the 3-in-1 solution enables connected data loading by integrating data from multiple sources on the aircraft and sending it in real time to and from ground servers.

Give your flight departments and pilots the ability to send and receive data whether an aircraft is in the hangar or in the sky! And unlock the full potential of your data to take advantage of new Connected Aircraft services!
