    <textOnly>&lt;[[https://aerospace.honeywell.com/]]&gt;
Dear Channel Partner, 
  
As previously communicated, all channel partners must now use the MyAerospace Portal &lt;https://myaerospace.honeywell.com/&gt; for placing all repair and overhaul (R&amp;O) orders. {{company.Company Name:default=edit me}} performance shows only {{lead.Portal Percentage:default=edit me}} of your R&amp;O orders were created in MyAerospace between the 21st and the 27th of January. Please follow this policy immediately for all new repair orders or your orders are at risk of being held in receiving. 
  
There are many benefits to using MyAerospace, including these new features: 

 	- For part modifications and upgrades, the mod-to part number is now displayed on the order confirmation 	-   Repair sheet .pdf documents are now emailed to the user after repair order entry   	-   Repair part serial numbers are now intuitively editable on the review screen   	-   Removal requirement date for repair orders is extended   	-   Expected lead time is now displayed at checkout   	-   Repair order entry training documentation is more detailed and easy to use.   

 
In the near future, we will be making the following enhancements: 

 	-   Use a spreadsheet-style template to submit multiple line items at once   	-   Bypass the part information window for faster order entry   	-   Edit multiple line items as needed before submitting your order   

 
Activity Summary: {{company.Company Name:default=edit me}} R&amp;O Order Compliance from 21 - 27 January: 

 	-   MyAerospace R&amp;O orders – {{lead.Portal Order:default=edit me}}   	-   Manual R&amp;O orders – {{lead.Manual Order:default=edit me}}   	-   MyAerospace utilization – {{lead.Portal Percentage:default=edit me}}
