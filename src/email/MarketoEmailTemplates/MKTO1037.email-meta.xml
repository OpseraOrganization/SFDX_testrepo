HONEYWELL TECHNICAL MANUALS NOW DELIVERED ONLINE


Honeywell technical publications distributed in paper format will be transitioned to a downloadable online delivery solution only through the MyAerospace &lt;[[https://myaerospace.honeywell.com/wps/portal/]]&gt; portal. This transition to online is good news for you and every Honeywell customer. With it, we can keep important information accurate and up-to-date and more efficiently answer your questions. With online access to publications you have access to the automated notification system to alert you when there are newly released or revised documents to view or download. In addition, we are proud to play our part in being a good environmental steward.

In order to transition paper publications to online access we will email the contacts at each company who have the active paper publications on their account. In cases where email address for the contact is not available, we will mail a letter to the contact at the shipping address on file for the publication. In both cases, we require a response in order to verify information and transition the publication(s) to online access on the MyAerospace &lt;[[https://myaerospace.honeywell.com/wps/portal/]]&gt; portal. If you have any questions or concerns with this transition please do not hesitate to contact the publications team at pubs@honeywell.com &lt;[[mailto:pubs@honeywell.com]]&gt;. We appreciate your support in our efforts to better serve you while “going green”!
