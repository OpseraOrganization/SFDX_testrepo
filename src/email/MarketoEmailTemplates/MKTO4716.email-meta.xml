    <subject>Unlock Operational Efficiency Through the CMU Mark II+</subject>
    <textOnly>The Mark II+ Communications Management Unit (CMU) enables data and messaging transfers between airborne and ground-based systems by hosting communications protocols that allow for messages to be routed over various channels.

The CMU Mark II+ provides access to &quot;big data&quot; from onboard avionics systems, enables analytics that improve fuel efficiency and ensure schedule integrity, and facilitates operational efficiencies

With this upgrade, your aircraft will be best equipped, best served!

Available functionalities with Mark II+:


	- Push to load – Ability for pilots to acknowledge an ATC message and push to load it into the flight plan, reducing the risk of “typos” when updating the flight plan




	- FANS 1/A (Oceanic)




	- VDL M2 multi-frequency (for domestic US) - CMU has the ability to switch between frequencies when certain VHF frequencies are clogged




	- ATN B1 (for Europe)
