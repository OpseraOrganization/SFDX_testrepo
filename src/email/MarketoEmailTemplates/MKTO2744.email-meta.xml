Dear Customers,


The BendixKing AeroVue™ Integrated Flight Deck &lt;[[https://bendixking.com/en/products/aerovue]]&gt; provides all new avionics for your King Air B200. Replacing legacy cockpit instruments with new glass reduces recurring maintenance costs. This worry-free hardware is covered under warranty for two years! Plus, by acting now you can receive an additional two years of coverage included with Honeywell’s Avionics Protection Program.
This year at Oshkosh we will be offering demonstration flights to King Air B200 owners and ground demonstrations to interested parties.
