    <textOnly>Honeywell has teamed up with VCOM Technologies Ltd to provide a one-stop shop DU-1310-2 inventory management and distribution service for customers in the Asia Pacific region. This joint-service will minimize lead time and cost in procuring such parts in-region.

 As this is an on-wing upgradable option, no Supplemental Type Certificate (STC) is required but an authorized engineer could sign off subject modification.

 BACKGROUND

 The DU-1310 cockpit display unit provides business aviation operators equipped with the Primus Epic 
platform a high-resolution primary or multifunction liquid crystal display (LCD) for enhanced situational awareness. As the previous model DU1310-1 is deemed Beyond Economic Repair (BER) due to obsolescence (Reference SIL D201303000004 and SIL D201608000036), Honeywell is now introducing the new model DU1310-2.

 The latest version DU1310-2 is a form, fit, function replacement for the current DU1310-1, and it is fully interchangeable and intermixable with the DU1310-1.
