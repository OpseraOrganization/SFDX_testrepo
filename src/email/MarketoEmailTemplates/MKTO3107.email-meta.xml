Introducing Aspire 200 - A revolution in airborne connectivity

Dear{{lead.Salutation:default=edit me}} {{lead.Last Name:default=Valued customer}}
In today’s fast paced world, you need and want to stay connected everywhere, all the time. And nowhere is this more important than when you are flying at 35,000ft.
 
 As an owner/operator of a Challenger aircraft you’ll be particularly interested to hear that MNG Jet has the STC available for Honeywell’s Aspire 200 satcom system for the CL300. You can now upgrade your aircraft to enjoy the benefits of seamless high quality SwiftBroadBand voice and data connectivity.
 
The Aspire 200 Inmarsat SwiftBroadband Satcom is Honeywell’s most economical connectivity solution offering high speed data capability. Designed to be a compact, lightweight Satcom for mid-size business jets, the Aspire 200’s high level of performance and two antenna options make it a suitable choice for all size aircraft, including helicopters, whose cabin voice and data connectivity needs can be met with a single-channel of SwiftBroadband service.

Honeywell and MNG Jet have joined together to offer Challenger owners and operators a unique installation and subscription offer for a fly-away price of just US$140,000 plus a competitive monthly data package of just US$3,800.
