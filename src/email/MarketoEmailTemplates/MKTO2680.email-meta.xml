Dear Valued Channel Partner,



Honeywell’s TFE731 certified engine exchange program helps your customers get another couple trips or even a couple more years out of their aircraft by offering several different options and price points to fit their budget.

Purchase a TFE731 outright or exchange your customer’s TFE731 engine with Honeywell – it’s that simple.

When you exchange your customer’s TFE731 engine, your customer will receive a minimum core value for their trade-in. Plus, they’ll receive up to a one year warranty on the purchased engine and we’ll pay for shipping both ways.

And the best part? Honeywell channel partners can receive a discount on eligible TFE731 engines. 

Browse our certified, pre-owned TFE731 inventory and choose the engine that’s right for your customer today.
