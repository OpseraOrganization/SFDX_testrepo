AEA International Convention &amp; Trade Show
April 8 - 11, 2015 in Dallas, TX

We are excited to once again be a part of the Aircraft Electronics Association(AEA) International Convention &amp; Trade Show. The annual event offers a unique opportunity to connect with manufacturers, distributors, technicians and business leaders as we work together to shape the future of avionics.

During the speaking sessions, we will provide valuable information on mandate compliance and upgrade solutions as well as Satcom solutions for the connected aircraft. BendixKing will be on hand as well to discuss tech tips and AeroWave 100, an in-flight Internet system for general aviation aircraft.
