Honeywell wants you to see for yourself.
Dear
Last month we emailed you an introduction to Honeywell Standard Pricing, and we made some pretty big claims. We also promised that we’d supply the information you need, in order to see what Standard Pricing will do for your company.



 




So here you go.
Open the attachment and you’ll find an Excel spread sheet compiled just for you. On that list is every product or service you ordered in the past year that’s now covered by Honeywell Standard Pricing, as well as the price. Upload the spreadsheet into your systems, and you’re ready for instant ordering – without the time-consuming quote process.
 
Part Number 
Part Price

 



Take a look. Do the math. We’re confident you’ll find Standard Pricing makes doing business with Honeywell faster, more predictable, and less expensive for you. That’s the bottom line.</textOnly>
