    <subject>The Endless Benefits that Come with Honeywell’s CDS/R Upgrade</subject>
    <textOnly>&lt;[[https://aerospace.honeywell.com/]]&gt;      &lt;[[https://www.duncanaviation.aero/]]&gt;

Honeywell’s Primus Epic® control display system/retrofit (CDS/R) was designed to improve safety and situational awareness in the cockpit. By combining some of Honeywell’s latest technology like the DU-1080 LCD displays, FMS 6.1 software, earth ground proximity system (EGPWS) and weather radar, CDS/R is the complete package to help Falcon 900A/B operators navigate the skies easier than ever before. 
 
Among the additional safety benefits, there are several cost-saving benefits to CDS-R, too. On average, customers who upgrade to CDS/R save $500/per pound per year by eliminating outdated wiring and the power supplying these systems. 
 
To show Honeywell’s commitment to supporting CDS/R, Falcon 900A/B operators who upgrade are eligible for one free year of HAPP after installation has been complete, and a $10,000 discount off years 2 and 3 of their 3-year or 5-year contract. As an added benefit, Honeywell is offering fixed year-over-year pricing on 5-year contracts. 
 
Start saving time and money when you upgrade to CDS/R for Falcon 900A/B. Contact Duncan Aviation to schedule your upgrade today.
