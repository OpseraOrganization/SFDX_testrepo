Low Visibility? 
 
No Problem!
Honeywell&apos;s Synthetic Vision System (SVS) is an advanced feature available with the Primus Elite upgrade that makes flying into the world’s most challenging airports easier by giving you a view of the terrain, as well as additional information like the runway outline, the breadcrumb trail leading to the runway and the plane’s exact flight path. The increased level of situational awareness you’ll experience will pay dividends when flying to unfamiliar locations, in bad weather, or at night.
&quot;With synthetic vision, I would have been able to see ahead of the aircraft. I would have been able to see exactly where the runway was. So instead of just seeing clouds in front of me, like when I flew into Aspen, I would have been able to see the runway out there and our flight path into the airport. It would have made my job a lot easier.” - Nate Turner, Pilot
