    <subject>Replace Your HG9900 With Honeywell’s Smaller, Near-Navigation HG5700 IMU</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi {{lead.First Name:default=edit me}}, 

 Was the HG9900 more than your mission could handle?

 If you’re in the market for a smaller, high performance, non-ITAR, gyrocompass-grade IMU or INS (IMU+ Nav Software), Honeywell’s new HG5700 MEMS IMU &lt;[[https://aerospace.honeywell.com/en/learn/products/sensors/hg5700-inertial-measurement-unit?utm_source=email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=20_rmus_jj&amp;utm_content=hg9900&amp;utm_term=m1]]&gt; is an affordable, near-navigation option designed for your application. 

 For guidance and control applications where precision pointing and navigation are important to the success of your mission, our HG5700’s three ring laser gyroscopes, three vibrating beam accelerometers and electronics combine to provide one of the most rugged and accurate inertial navigation solutions on the market today.
