According to a recent analysis, hundreds of business aircraft are operating with an obsolete SATCOM system. Should the SD-600 Satellite Data unit fail, it cannot be repaired or exchanged, leaving the aircraft unable to operate in FANS 1/A airspace.

Be Proactive! Mitigate and/or avoid the risk associated with potential SD-600 failures by upgrading your aircraft with the SD-700 SDU. Or, if you want an even more advanced system, considering upgrading to Swiftbroadband MCS-7120 system. The MCS-7120 system is certified for FANS 1/A Safety Services and offers two channels of Inmarsat Swiftbroadband, so passengers can stay connected from the moment they board the aircraft until they deplane.
Don’t operate with obsolete equipment. Contact Constant Aviation to learn more or to request a quote.
