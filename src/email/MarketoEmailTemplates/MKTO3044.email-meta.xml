Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Customer}},


More than 100 business jets &lt;[[https://aerospace.honeywell.com/en/press-release-listing/2017/october/over-100-business-jets-now-flying-with-honeywell-inmarsat-high-speed-wi-fi]]&gt; have already installed Honeywell’s JetWave™ system, which exclusively powers Inmarsat’s Jet ConneX service. This rapid adoption is attributed to forward-thinking manufacturers, maintenance professionals and owners/operators who were unhappy with previous connectivity options and believed in the Honeywell-Inmarsat solution.

There’s a reason why JetWave is the only high-speed connectivity system to be selected by all major business jet manufacturers – it’s the only high-speed, global, in-flight Wi-Fi service for the business aviation industry available today!

What are you waiting for? Contact Honeywell to learn more now!
