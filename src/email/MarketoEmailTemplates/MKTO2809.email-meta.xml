UPDATE YOUR SYSTEMS FOR GENERATOR REPAIR LOCATIONS
Dear Customer:
You have received this email because our records indicate that this information is relevant to you. If you no longer need this information, please click here &lt;[[https://pages3.honeywell.com/Distribution-Update.html]]&gt; to 
update your information.

We are always looking for ways to improve your experience with us. To better manage our factory capacity across our repair network, we will start repairing our Boeing 737 APU Starter Generators (parts 28B545-7 and 28B545-9) exclusively at our Tulsa, Oklahoma and Taeco Xiamen, China sites. They will no longer be repaired at our Tucson, Arizona facility. This will allow us to better meet your delivery expectations. 
 
What do you need to know? 


	- The Tucson, Arizona site will no longer perform repairs for these generators.
	- Please send repairs to the site closest to you: Tulsa, Oklahoma or Taeco in Xiamen, China.
	- Access the MyAerospace Repair Capabilities &lt;[[https://myaerospace2.honeywell.com/onlineordering/repair-capabilities/]]&gt; tool after Aug. 29, 2018 to view these updates and access site addresses and certifications, as reflected in this file &lt;https://pages3.honeywell.com/rs/641-QIX-912/images/APUStarteGenerators_SitesCerts.png&gt;.
	- Existing repair orders at Tucson are still being processed and repaired – no change is required for these units.
	- If the Tulsa and TAECO sites are not established for use in your system, please set them up. In the meantime, contact your customer support representative to make short term arrangements.
