Get Discounted Pricing on Your Turbine Rotor Replacement When You Schedule by August 30, 2019


In August 2012, the FAA released Airworthiness Directive 2012-17-05 for TFE731-4 and TFE731-5, requiring operators to replace LPT1 rotor assemblies by August 2020. With the compliance deadline looming, a large volume of operators still need to comply. Operators who wait could face limited parts availability and maintenance delays as the deadline approaches. 
 
Dallas Airmotive, a Honeywell TFE731 Authorized Service Center and the 2018 Americas Channel Partner of the Year award winner, is offering discounted pricing on the replacement turbine rotor to customers who schedule their maintenance by August 30, 2019. 
 
Stay on budget and donâ€™t get off-schedule with maintenance or flight plans. To learn more, contact Dallas Airmotive at (612) 284-9733 &lt;tel:6122849733&gt; or online by clicking below!
