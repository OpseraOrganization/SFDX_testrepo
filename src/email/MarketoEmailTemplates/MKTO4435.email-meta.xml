    <subject>Is your aircraft safe from cyber-intruders?</subject>
    <textOnly>A business jet cabin is your office in the sky. Just like on the ground, you need to know the devices you use, the data you send and receive, and the files you access are protected from prying eyes. 

 Our always-on cybersecurity protection comes standard with all Honeywell business aviation solutions, including our industry-leading JetWave satellite communications system and Honeywell Forge cabin connectivity and flight services platform, which can constantly monitor your cybersecurity status. 

 You won’t find a “cybersecurity” line item on your Honeywell invoice, because we don’t charge extra for the essential protection you need to safeguard sensitive information. We go above and beyond by also offering the first real-time intrusion-protection capability. 

When you fly with JetWave and Honeywell Forge, you’re also flying with our global team of security experts, who stand ready to help you face any cybersecurity challenge.
