How does Brad Keselowski get to the Green Flag on time?

On his Honeywell-equipped Lear 45!
Brad Keselowski&apos;s Lear 45 has been upgraded with the Primus Elite DU-875 liquid crystal displays, mandate-compliant ADS-B, GoDirect Flight Sentinel and an XM satellite weather package.

The new DU-875 displays are easy to install, are brighter and last longer, reduce weight, and increase Aircraft Blue Book value -- which Brad&apos;s accountant loves.
Just as Brad and his pit crew continually adjust his car as track conditions change, Honeywell&apos;s satellite weather and flight data packages provide continuous weather and traffic information to Brad&apos;s pilots. Flight plans can be adjusted as conditions change, assuring Brad is always there ready for the green flag.
To learn more about how you can experience the same in-flight edge that Brad enjoys, contact Honeywell today.
