    <textOnly>Hi {{lead.First Name:default=there}}, 

Because Honeywell’s MSP Avionics plan no longer covers Laseref II or III, you might be paying more for repairs to keep them up and running than you would if you upgraded to Laseref IV. 

 When you upgrade, you’ll notice the following benefits in addition to knowing your new Laseref IV is covered by our MSP Avionics plan:



	- Improved cost of maintenance with a modular design and assembly
	- MTBF (Mean Time Between Failures) consistently exceeds 40,000 hours
	- MTBUR (Mean Time Between Unscheduled Removals) more than 20,000 hours since service entry in 1997
	- 25 pounds lighter than LASEREF II and 10 pounds lighter than LASEREF III
	- 30 percent improvement in demonstrated reliability


If you have any questions about what I just shared, please feel free to connect with me directly. I’m here to help.

I look forward to hearing from you.

 Sincerely,
