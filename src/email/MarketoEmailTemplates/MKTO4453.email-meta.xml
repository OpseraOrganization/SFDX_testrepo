    <textOnly>Hi {{lead.First Name:default=there}},

Haven’t heard from you in a while, but I want to share a couple videos that I thought you might enjoy.



	- Honeywell’s HG4930 survives 80mph hits from a hockey team &lt;[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGWuTsv5rBs&amp;vl=en]]&gt;
	- HGuide n580 is scorched in the Sonoran Desert with a flame thrower &lt;[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Zmt1GuKD8s]]&gt;


Let me know if you’re still interested in talking about our HGuide products. 

 I look forward to hearing from you. 

Best,
{{lead.hGuide Sales Owner Full Name:default=Hguide Support}}</textOnly>
