    <subject>It’s Not Too Late! Save on ADS-B When You Upgrade to Primus Elite</subject>
    <textOnly>&lt;[[https://aerospace.honeywell.com/]]&gt;

There has never been a better time than now to improve the safety and situational awareness of your Learjet 45 – but the clock is ticking!

For a limited time, when you upgrade two or more of your obsolete DU-870 displays to DU-875 on your Learjet 40/45, Flightstar will waive STC cost for your ADS-B out upgrade (a $7k value). This is on top of Honeywell incentives that include a $35,000 trade-in credit per DU-870 display unit and additional savings on your Honeywell Maintenance Service Plan – Avionics (formally known as HAPP). 

This offer expires when capacity is filled so don’t delay.  Contact Flightstar today to discuss your needs and request a quote.
