Embraer 135/145 ADS-B Out STC by New United Goderich

By January 1st, 2020* all aircraft operating in North America airspace will be required to transmit ADS-B positioning information in compliance with DO 260B.

After this deadline, non-compliant aircrafts will be effectively grounded! 

There are hundreds of non-compliant aircrafts in the US requiring upgrade prior to 
January 2020. As this date approaches the cost of the upgrade will increase as parts and hanger availability declines.

Do you have a crystal-clear plan for securing the required hardware and upgrading your Embraer 135/145 fleet in time to comply with these mandates?

Honeywell and New United Goderich have the right solution with the ADS-B (out) STC - (ST03177NY) for Embraer 135/145. 

The modification incorporates Honeywell’s RCZ-8XXM Mode S Extended Squitter transponders and FreeFlight Systems’ 1203C SBAS/GNSS sensor for a complete ADS-B (Out) solution, including full Installations at New United Goderich facility or the acquisition of partial Installation Kits for the ADS-B (OUT) STC.
