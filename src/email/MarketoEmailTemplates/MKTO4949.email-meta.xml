    <subject>Honeywell and Duncan Aviation - new repair and exchange support</subject>
    <textOnly>In December 2020, Honeywell informed our customers of a repair services agreement with Duncan Aviation that will enhance product support for our business aviation, commercial, and helicopters customers. Under the license agreement, Duncan Aviation will manage the repair and exchange for specified Avionics Content, Flight Controls, Electronic Flight Control Instruments, Air Data, and Attitude Heading Reference Unit on Legacy Platforms. This covers more than 2,000 Honeywell part numbers on nearly 100 fixed and rotor-wing aircraft platforms, building upon the existing authorizations in place with Duncan Aviation as a licensed Honeywell Authorized Service Center and Channel Partner. 

 Why are we making this change?
 Duncan Aviation has 65 years of experience dedicated to the business &amp; general aviation market with complete Maintenance, Repair, and Overhaul (MRO) facilities in the US and strategically placed regional shops that can provide services 24/7 worldwide. In addition to global coverage, this agreement enables immediate access to parts as Duncan Aviation will maintain an inventory to support our customers globally. 

What is changing?
 

 	- All future repair and exchange orders previously processed through Honeywell for these product categories will be placed through Duncan Aviation.
