    <textOnly>Dear Customer,

The world is facing an unprecedented challenge from COVID-19 and during this crisis we wanted to reach out to let you know we are with you in the fight against the pandemic.  

We understand that you, our military customers, need to be ready to support any mission that is requested of you. As a result, we continue to monitor the global impact of the crisis and are complying with all official bodies and directives.  We activated our global incident management team several weeks ago, and all our sites have plans in place to ensure business continuity with specific roles and responsibilities assigned to address anticipated challenges.

During these difficult times, we hope that you, your family, your colleagues and employees are well. This crisis brings us all together in a united effort to combat the effects of COVID-19 on our communities, no matter where are in the world.

As always, we very much appreciate your business and understanding in this rapidly shifting environment. Please do not hesitate to contact your Honeywell sales representative or customer support manager with any additional questions, or visit our virus-related &lt;[[https://aerospace.honeywell.com/en/pages/aero-covid-19]]&gt; website.

Please remain vigilant and stay healthy.

Sincerely,

Cooper Cullen
Senior Director
