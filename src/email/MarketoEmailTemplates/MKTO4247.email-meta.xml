    <subject>PLEASE READ â€“ Honeywell at AEA</subject>
    <textOnly>To ensure the safety of our people during the coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak, Honeywell and BendixKing have decided to withdraw from the AEA show in Nashville. This decision was made from an abundance of caution based upon prioritizing the health of everyone involved. 

 AEA is an important event for us, you and the industry. We remain dedicated to keeping you informed with alternative methods to share product announcements, details and training planned for the show. 

 Please contact your Honeywell or BendixKing Sales Manager with any questions.</textOnly>
