Last week, we launched our new HGuide n380 inertial navigation system (INS/GNSS).

Engineered to complement our existing HGuide portfolio and meet customer demand, the HGuide n380 is a small, lightweight and highly 
reliable INS/GNSS that performs well in areas where continuous position and attitude navigation data is required.

Its competitive price, rugged design and high performance are ideal for customer applications ranging from UAVs to mobile mapping, autonomous vehicles and more. 

In this announcement, you&apos;ll find a few helpful resources to introduce you to the HGuide n380. To read our official press release, please click here &lt;[[https://aerospace.honeywell.com/en/learn/about-us/press-release/2020/07/honeywell-expands-navigation-offerings]]&gt;.
The HGuide n380 blends data from our leading-edge i300 inertial measurement unit and a powerful dual-antenna, multi-frequency, multi-constellation RTK capable GNSS receiver.
