    <subject>Improve your cockpit outlook with Honeywell’s DU-875 installed by Pentastar</subject>
    <textOnly>Transform the performance, safety and value of your aircraft with the Honeywell Primus Elite DU-875 upgrade installed with minimal downtime by the professionals at Pentastar Aviation. 

 More than a display upgrade, the DU-875 is an entirely new avionics system. Initially designed to overcome upcoming cathode ray tubes (CRT) obsolescence, the Primus Elite DU-875 upgrade delivers some serious functionality, plus enhanced flight management tools, future growth capability, improved reliability and reduced weight. 

 The DU-875 liquid crystal displays deliver brighter, clearer, higher resolution images, and 2X the reliability of your old, obsolete DU-870 CRTs.

 The upgrade is an easy “plug and play” replacement that can be done in less than a day. What’s more the DU-875 display update doesn’t require additional pilot training or modifications to the cockpit. 

 Still not sure? Contact Pentastar Aviation for more information and inquire about having them come to you for the install to further eliminate your aircraft downtime.
