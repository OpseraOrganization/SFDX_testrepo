CUSTOMER SUCCESS STORY: AVIONICS SALES CORPORATION AND WINGS 
INTERNATIONAL 
When United Wings International first signed on with a charter operator, it had to guarantee the availability of a reliable Wi-Fi system on board. After looking at different options, the aircraft management company, with Avionics Sales Corporation’s expertise, determined that BendixKing’s AeroWave 100 &lt;[[https://www.bendixking.com/en/products/aerowave-100]]&gt; was the best fit because of its small antenna, only-pay-for-what-you-use business model and reliable connectivity on 
the ground and in the air. 

“It&apos;s extremely important to have a reliable Wi-Fi system in a charter jet. In fact, most businesspeople will not even get on an aircraft that doesn’t have a reliable Wi-Fi system.” Watch the Video&gt;&gt; &lt;[[https://youtu.be/oWQxKihk_5Q]]&gt;</textOnly>
