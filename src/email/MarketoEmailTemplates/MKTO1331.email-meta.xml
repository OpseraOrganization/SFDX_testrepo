Sikorsky has authorized Honeywell and our distributors to provide HUMS hardware directly to organizations that operate S-76C++ helicopters.
With our HUMS technology onboard, S-76C++ operators have easy access to the information they can use to enhance safety, improve aircraft availability and reduce maintenance costs and maintenance hours. HUMS products collect, process, and interpret data generated by various aircraft systems including rotating and vibrating parts, on the helicopter.
