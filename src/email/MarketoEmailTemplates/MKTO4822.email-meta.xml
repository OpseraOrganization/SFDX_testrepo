    <subject>Honeywell Transitioning Work From Our Loyang, Singapore Facility Starting December 2020</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear Customer, 
 
Honeywell continually evaluates our business portfolio to optimize and 
better serve our customers. After a thorough evaluation, we have decided to close the Loyang Repair and Overhaul Service Center site and move the work to our Penang OEM site in phases starting in December 2020. ERB/SPEX work will move from Loyang, Singapore to Gul Circle, Singapore. Our commitment to customer service does not wane during a transition.
 
 The impacted parts list &lt;[[https://pages3.honeywell.com/rs/641-QIX-912/images/Loyang - Part Numbers.xlsx]]&gt;Â is provided for your use and review. Overall, we expect these changes to be seamless for you and are committed to zero interruptions in service. We have established a dedicated transition team composed of functional experts and leaders to manage the transition process and ensure there is no break in service or shipments during this period. 
 
 We will continue to keep you updated, providing plenty of notice and instructions for changes that will affect you or actions that you will need to complete in the coming months. In the meantime, if you have any questions, please contact your Honeywell point of contact. 
 
 We are always working to give you the quality and the service you deserve. 
 
 Sincerely, 
 
 Honeywell Aerospace
