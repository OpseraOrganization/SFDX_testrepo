    <subject>New Update on our Anniston, Alabama Site Recovery</subject>
    <textOnly>&lt;[[https://aerospace.honeywell.com/]]&gt;

Dear Customer,
 
Thank you for your continued patience while we’ve been working to resume operations at our Anniston, Alabama facility after sustaining storm damage on August 14th.  
 
The Anniston site has begun operations and is now receiving new customer units for repair. The site is no longer re-directing units to the Tempe facility and Anniston repairs have been re-activated in the MyAerospace Repair Capabilities system. Estimated ship dates will be available on September 8th for units in the repair process. 
 
Due to damage on the repair line for Apparatebau Gauting GmbH (AOA) components, we request that repair units be sent directly to AOA until further notice at the following address:
 
Apparatebau Gauting GmbH
Zum Windkanal 10 
D-01109 Dresden
Germany
 
If you are unsure whether this impacts you or if you have any questions, please contact your Honeywell account leader. If you do not know who that is, please visit the MyAerospace contact us page &lt;[[https://myaerospace.honeywell.com/contact-us]]&gt;.
             
We are working hard to minimize impact to your operations. Again, thank you for your patience throughout this process.
Thank you for your business,
Honeywell Aerospace Customer &amp; Product Support
