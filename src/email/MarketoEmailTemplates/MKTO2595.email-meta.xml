    <subject>ADS-B Mandate: Will it Affect You?</subject>
    <textOnly>&lt;[[https://aerospace.honeywell.com/]]&gt;

By 2020 all aircraft including military, operating in either U.S or European* air space, will be required to transmit ADS-B positioning information in compliance with DO-260B. Do you have a crystal-clear plan for securing the required hardware and upgrading your fleet in-time to comply with these mandates? 

With the mandate deadline just two years away, we recommend that you act now. Product availability and service center capacity will become increasingly scarce as we approach the FAA and EASA deadlines. This could impact your aircraft being updated in time.
