    <subject>Important Notice: Change to Inmarsat Policy – Honeywell Forge</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear Valued Customer, 

 We are writing to inform you about a change to Inmarsat’s services policy as a result of updates they are making this summer. Starting on September 1, 2020, you will start to see monthly overage charges applied to all airtime service accounts that exceed their allocated data usage. 

 We understand that policy changes like this are not ideal, so our team has been working for the last year to develop a wide range of data management tools that help manage data use and reduce cost. These include features that enable you to easily allocate charges to particular passengers, departments or devices; control the type of content sent and received during flight; and manage the bandwidth allocated to different uses, including video streaming. 

 Many of these tools are available now and built into your service portal, including information on monthly data usage and video bandwidth controls. You can view our tutorial on video bandwidth controls here &lt;[[https://watch.honeywell.com/watch/zDr5z8Y6MivwQ8kMdDMtxP]]&gt;. 

In addition, we are preparing two premium services to further enhance your experience while preventing overages: 





	- For the first time, you will have the option to extend the use of our popular video bandwidth control tools to all data types. You will be able to allocate bandwidth according to data type as well as manage the allowable data volume.
	- For customers who prefer a Honeywell-managed plan vs self-service option, we are preparing hassle-free options that optimize passenger experience while minimizing overage risk.



More information will be available soon. In the meantime, if you have any questions about your current data usage and available options to mitigate overage risk, please speak with your Honeywell Forge field service engineer.

 Thank you,
