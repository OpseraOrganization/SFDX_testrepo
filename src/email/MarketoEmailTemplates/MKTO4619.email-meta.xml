    <subject>Special offers for {{lead.ABM Company Name:default=your company}}</subject>
    <textOnly>Hello once again {{lead.First Name:default=Friend}},

We recently communicated with you about making the most of your company&apos;s aircraft downtime. 

In many cases, with new and updated Honeywell equipment, there may be total-cost-of-ownership savings, support savings and even reliability increases. Yet even with all these advantages, we know that the decision might still come down to matters of pricing. After all, it’s up to you to make the best recommendations, and that includes thinking about costs.

With that in mind, we would like to invite you to see the special offers we’ve curated just for you.
