Hi {{lead.First Name:default=there}},

 In this issue of Honeywell&apos;s HGuide Highlights, we cover a variety of topics, including: the advantages and disadvantages of an inertial navigation system, how our HGuide n580 recently helped a mobile mapping company achieve higher data accuracy and a video from a test we conducted with a collegiate hockey team.

THE ADVANTAGES VS DISADVANTAGES OF AN INERTIAL NAVIGATION SYSTEM
We surveyed our HGuide engineers to help you better understand the advantages and disadvantages of using an inertial navigation system as compared to an inertial measurement unit.

IMPROVING MAPPING SYSTEMS WITH INERTIAL NAVIGATION SYSTEMS
Honeywell’s HGuide n580 inertial navigation system improves the accuracy of Horus’ mobile mapping software by providing high reliable navigation data in GNSS-denied areas.  Watch the video &lt;[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBqsaN9nHuM]]&gt;

HONEYWELL HG4930 INERTIAL MEASUREMENT USED AS A HOCKEY PUCK
We let a collegiate hockey team hit our HG4930 IMU at speeds up to 80 MPH to see if it&apos;d work after taking some serious damage.  Watch the video  &lt;[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGWuTsv5rBs]]&gt; to see if it survived the test.
