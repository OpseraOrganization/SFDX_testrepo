Dear Valued Customer,

Don&apos;t forget what time it is. Time to enter our drawing for an Apple Watch by answering a few questions about your aircraft usage!

We&apos;re asking you to take a short survey about how you intend to operate your turbo fan engine equipped aircraft in 2020. 

The survey should take about 5 minutes to complete. Your participation in the Turbo Fan Engine Survey is voluntary, and if you choose to include your personal contact information, you&apos;ll be entered in a drawing for an Apple Watch (Please read Official Rules &lt;[[https://aerospace.honeywell.com/en/pages/survey-drawing]]&gt;).

Again, thank you 
in advance for providing your feedback! We appreciate your help with improving and evolving our products.






TAKE THE SURVEY &lt;[[https://survey.sjc1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_e9bbfrSFV7WxXmt]]&gt;





If you aren&apos;t the appropriate person to fill out this survey, please forward to the right person. Thank you.</textOnly>
