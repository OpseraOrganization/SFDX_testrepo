Dear Valued Customer,  

Honeywell International Sàrl continuously looks for ways to improve how we conduct business with you and in order to create a more efficient and effective procurement experience for you, we will be implementing further distribution enhancements to both our operating system and our ERP system on Saturday, November 9th, 2013, and Sunday, November 10th, 2013. 

To ensure this change is implemented successfully and with no customer interruptions, we would like to inform you about a temporary suspension in the distribution of spare parts from the Honeywell International Sàrl distribution center in Hemel Hempstead, UK, on Saturday, November 9th, 2013, and Sunday, November 10th, 2013. During this time, we will also be unable to accept and process any same day shipment requests received on Friday, November 8th, 2013.  

The distribution center will resume standard support and operating hours on Monday, November 11th, 2013. 

This interruption will not impact your business with Honeywell International Sàrl, neither will it impact nor delay support of Aircraft on Ground (AOG) orders received during the suspension.

Please share this communication and future information with others in your organization as appropriate.

Thank you for your support as we work to enhance the way Honeywell International Sàrl does business with you. 

Sincerely, 

Honeywell Aerospace
