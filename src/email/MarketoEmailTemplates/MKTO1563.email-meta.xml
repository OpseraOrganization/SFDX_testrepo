 The purpose of this document is to summarize the technical and certification information to support development of Supplemental Type Certificates (STC) for the Honeywell DLMU-W system. It is intended to provide High-Level System Description, Installation and Certification considerations for the Honeywell RMU system.


The DLMU-W is a drop-in replacement for previous Data Management Unit (DMU) and Data LAN Management Unit (DLMU) data loaders offered by Honeywell. It provides secure wireless connectivity (embedded 802.11b/g/n wireless (Wi-Fi) technology) to the Primus Epic cockpit, enabling wireless database loading and a gateway for mobile apps.
