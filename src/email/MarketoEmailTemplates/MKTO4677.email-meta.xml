    <subject>Honeywell Aerospace Anniston, Alabama - Transition Plan &amp; Move Schedules</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear Honeywell Customer, 


Honeywell Aerospace recently provided an update regarding our Anniston site closure. In that communication, Honeywell provided the complete cut-over schedule and instructions on how to prepare for the upcoming transition. A copy of that communication can be found here &lt;[[https://pages3.honeywell.com/rs/641-QIX-912/images/Original Anniston Communication.pdf]]&gt;.  

This notice is to remind you of the upcoming ship-to changes required before 8/21/20 for Wave 1 &amp; Wave 2 part numbers. Tempe Repairs Site Capabilities &lt;[[https://aerospace2.honeywell.com/onlineordering/repair-capabilities/]]&gt; are currently active for all Wave 1 &amp; Wave 2 part numbers. 

The part numbers affected in this Wave 1 &amp; Wave 2 transition can be located here. &lt;[[https://pages3.honeywell.com/rs/641-QIX-912/images/Wave 1 and 2.xlsx]]&gt;

To minimize delays, please follow these guidelines and actions:

New Repair Orders

Shipment to Tempe of Wave 1 &amp; 2 parts can begin immediately. Tempe Repairs Site Capabilities have already been activated to facilitate shipment to Tempe. Anniston will no longer induct Wave 1 / 2 parts for repair, after 8/28/20. 


	- Units received at Anniston after 8/28/20 will be forwarded to Tempe.  The Honeywell Customer Support team will request an updated PO with the Tempe address to ensure the 8130 tag matches the repair station on your Purchase Order.  
	- Units received after 9/20/20 will be returned to the sender, for routing to the proper Honeywell Repair Station.



Existing Repair Orders

Anniston will work to complete all repairs that are in work as of 8/28/20. Any units received at Anniston after 8/28/20 will be forwarded to Tempe, AZ for repair processing. Tempe will process all repairs of Wave 1 &amp; 2 Part Numbers, going forward.

What to do now?


	- Ensure Tempe, AZ is qualified on your approved supplier list and update the Part Numbers in Wave 1 &amp; Wave 2 for shipment to Tempe starting 8/21/20. Anniston will no longer receive units after 8/28/20.
	- If you need to conduct an on-site audit for Tempe, please email Norman.Dubay@Honeywell.com &lt;[[mailto:Norman.Dubay@honeywell.com]]&gt; to request an audit.
