    <subject>Don&apos;t Miss This Unique VR Experience at NBAA!</subject>
    <textOnly>&lt;[[https://aerospace.honeywell.com/]]&gt;

As you finalize your agenda for NBAA, don&apos;t forget to include a stop by Duncan Aviation’s booth (#N2506) for the opportunity to engage in a unique Virtual Reality (VR) experience where you can learn about and interact with a TFE731 engine, and see it run in a virtual test cell. You&apos;ll also receive a special prize just for participating! 
Duncan Aviation will also be highlighting their full range of MRO and support services from Aircraft Sales and Acquisitions to Completions and Paint, and Airframe and Engine maintenance to Parts. The company will represent its three full-service facilities (Lincoln, Nebraska; Battle Creek, Michigan; and Provo, Utah) as well as its 25+ avionics satellite locations and worldwide Rapid Response Team engine services.
