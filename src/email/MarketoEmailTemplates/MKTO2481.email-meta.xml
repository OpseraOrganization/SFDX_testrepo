EASY ACCESS TO UPDATED PRICING ON MYAEROSPACE
Dear Customer, 
To support your order shipment with minimal interruption, we are reminding our customers to access our catalog each quarter for the latest pricing. Accessing the latest pricing information will ensure we can fulfill your order without having to contact you for more information. 
 
Important Information: 


	- Recent part pricing updates are effective on April 1st.  
	- Quotes or orders with shipment dates based on lead times or request dates on or after April 1st will reflect the latest pricing because 
pricing is based on your order ship date.  
	- Honeywell’s pricing policy applies to when an order is shipped.
	- You must update your vendor pricing systems to reflect the current catalog pricing in your purchase orders, unless you have contractual pricing with Honeywell.
	- Failure to update your system may result in order shipment delays since an updated purchase order will be 
required.



We encourage you to create a customer-specific pricing report &lt;[[https://myaerospace2.honeywell.com/onlineordering/pricing-reports/DynamicCatalog]]&gt; using the MyAerospace Portal. You can also use the MyAerospace online ordering application to review the price on your orders. On April 4th, you can download an updated generic  &lt;[[https://myaerospace.honeywell.com/parts-and-repairs/downloads/pricing-catalogs#sort=%40fdisplayname2077%20descending]]&gt;catalog from MyAerospace &lt;[[https://myaerospace.honeywell.com/parts-and-repairs/downloads/pricing-catalogs#sort=%40fdisplayname2077%20descending]]&gt;.     
 
Thank you for your cooperation in updating your systems to reflect current pricing. If you have any questions, please contact your Honeywell customer support contact or submit a question &lt;[[http://goaero.honeywell.com/TnZQ00E0n000zIt20qhrGX0]]&gt; through MyAerospace.
