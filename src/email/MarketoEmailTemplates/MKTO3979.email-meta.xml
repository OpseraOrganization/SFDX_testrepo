    <subject>Don’t Risk a CRT Display Failure on Your Lear 40/45!</subject>
    <textOnly>&lt;[[https://aerospace.honeywell.com/]]&gt;

Hello!

Are you sick and tired of your plane’s old, worn-out CRT displays with their poor color, weak contrast, and annoying flicker? Those screens are obsolete and no longer serviceable. It&apos;s time for a change.
Flightstar, a Honeywell Authorized Avionics Dealer, is now scheduling Primus Elite upgrades for Lear 40/45 customers, and offering a variety of upgrade paths to fit your budget and operational requirements, including:


	- A One-For-One Upgrade that offers a lower-cost, building blocks approach to Primus Elite by allowing you to replace one or several displays at a time.
	- Primus Elite Enhanced Features (PEEF), which replaces all your obsolete DU-870 displays, plus offers additional benefits like cursor control interface, advanced data loading with wireless options, optional XM weather, and improved situational awareness.


Plus, through December 31st save up to $140k thanks to a $35,000 Honeywell trade-in credit per DU-870 display you replace, and take advantage of special incentives on your Honeywell Maintenance Service Plan coverage. 
Stop flying in an outdated cockpit! Contact Flightstar to discuss your needs and request a quote.
