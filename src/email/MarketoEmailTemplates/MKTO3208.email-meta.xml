YOUR EXCLUSIVE INVITATION TO VIDEOCONFERENCE USING HONEYWELL’S ASPIRE® 200 SATCOM
HAI HELI-EXPO 
2019
Visit us at HAI Heli-Expo 2019 to try out Honeywell’s breakthrough satellite communications technology for helicopters, the Aspire 200. 
 
 Just look for the Honeywell logo and stop in to see us at Booth #C3107 for a free demonstration of the best videoconferencing capability flying.
 
 Aspire 200 is what helicopter SATCOM was always meant to be – fast, reliable and always available to deliver a connected-helicopter experience comparable to what you get on the ground. Global coverage over water and in remote locations. High data rates. Beyond line-of-sight capabilities. No rotor-blade interference. It’s all there! 
And don’t forget to visit the static display area to see how we’re helping SNC® breathe new life into the Sierra Force UH-60 Black Hawk with the Aspire 200, Sky Connect® Tracker III mission-management system, 36-150 auxiliary power unit and much more.
