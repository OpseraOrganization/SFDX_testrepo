YOUR OPINION MATTERS
Hello {{lead.First Name:default=Sir/Madam}},

Are you interested in being a part of the website development process? We have a perfect opportunity for you!

We are evaluating our website for navigation and design, so our user experience team is conducting one-hour user experience study. By participating in this study, you get to help us determine our future path, and you will receive a $100 Amazon gift card for your time.

To take part, please email Claudia.Guerrero@Honeywell.com &lt;[[mailto:Claudia.Guerrero@Honeywell.com]]&gt; 
ASAP. We are conducting the user experience study between Sept. 11-14th.

We look forward to hearing from you!
