Dear Customer, 

As part of our normal business process, Honeywell continually evaluates our business lines to determine how they fit into our long-term growth strategy. We have signed an exclusive perpetual licensing deal with Celestica for our 777cargo smoke detector product line. 

Celestica has been making and repairing the product line as part of a contract manufacturing agreement for the past few years. We expect the transition itself to be relatively easy. Over the next ninety days, we will finalize the details with Celestica. We anticipate that the transition will be completed in the following months. 

For now, there is no change in how you engage with Honeywell for orders. Once the transition is completed, you will place new equipment and repair orders directly with Celestica. In general, this change should be seamless for you and we donâ€™t expect any break in service or shipments. We see many advantages and benefits to this licensing deal, including improved delivery performance for our customers. 

We will continue to provide you with updates as necessary. If you have any questions, please contact your Honeywell representative. 

Sincerely, 

Customer and Product Support
