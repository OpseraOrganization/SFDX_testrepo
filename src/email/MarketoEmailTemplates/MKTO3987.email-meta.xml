Hi {{lead.First Name:default=there}},
It’s almost 2020 and if you are not using an integrated flight planning with scheduling software, then you might be missing out!
Honeywell Aerospace &lt;[[https://aerospace.honeywell.com/en/services/aerospace-services/flight-planning?utm_source=email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=19_godirectflight_bga&amp;utm_term=email7]]&gt; is the first and only software provider of its kind, tailored to save Chief Pilots like you, time and money.
So let’s get the process started. What time and date should I call you?
Best regards,
