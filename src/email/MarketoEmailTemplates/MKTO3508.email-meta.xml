    <subject>You Haven’t Upgraded Your Transponder Yet!? Time’s Ticking Away…</subject>
    <textOnly>&lt;[[https://aerospace.honeywell.com/]]&gt;

Dear Primus 1000 / 2000 Operator,
Time is flying towards the 2020 ADS-B Out mandate compliance deadline. 

Don&apos;t mark January 2020 on your calendar.Mark June 2019 or before!



Why June?


	- Upgrading usually takes of 10 days per aircraft, if the parts on are on the floor ready and waiting.
	- There are hundreds of non-compliant aircraft requiring upgrade and only a small number of service centers.


So, if you haven&apos;t scheduled your plane by June, you may be stuck. Unless you are willing to pay a very hefty premium.


Guarantee compliance, schedule today. The clock is ticking...
