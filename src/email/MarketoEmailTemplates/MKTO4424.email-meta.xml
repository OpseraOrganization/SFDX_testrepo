    <subject>Get Your Spares From A New Regional Distributor Today</subject>
    <textOnly>Sourcing genuine Honeywell spare parts for your airline’s Airbus and Boeing aircraft just got a lot easier, thanks to a new agreement between Honeywell and United Enterprise Group. 

 United Enterprise is now a non-exclusive distributor for most Honeywell mechanical and avionics line-replaceable units for a selected group of Honeywell’s Asia Pacific customers. As one of those customers, you will now be able to place orders directly with United Enterprise, an established and well-respected Honeywell channel partner.

 Having a trusted supply source in-region will streamline communications and order processing, while reducing lead-time and fulfillment costs for your company. United Enterprise will maintain inventory on a selected list of spare parts for various aircraft platforms, to enhance the efficiency of the order-fulfillment process. 

 The appointment of United Enterprise is part of Honeywell’s ongoing commitment to improve the parts-distribution process to meet the needs of our airline customers, here in the Asia Pacific region. 

 If you have questions or would like to learn more about this agreement, use the link below to provide your contact details and a United Enterprise customer service representative will connect with you.
