Newsletter Title
A Century of Customer Commitment

Tim Beatty, Vice President
Customer and Product Support 




This is a special month for Honeywell Aerospace as we celebrate 100 years of contributions to the aerospace industry.
We trace our heritage back to legacy companies including Sperry, Bendix, Garrett AiResearch, Pioneer, Lycoming, Grimes, King, AlliedSignal, EMS Technologies and many others. We are proud to be associated with these legendary names and the record of innovation and customer service they represent.

Today&apos;s 
Honeywell Aerospace would not exist without valued customers and partners like you. We appreciate your business and are committed to continuously improving the support we provide you. Our goal is to simplify and enhance the customer experience for members of the pilot and flight operations communities.

This newsletter covers some 
of the steps that we&apos;ve taken to improve the Honeywell User Experience in the last year. For example: 




 - 

We strengthened our Global Customer Committee (GCC) by expanding membership to almost 90 members, increasing the effectiveness of our European Customer Committee and launching an Asia-Pacific Customer Committee.






 - 

We made it easier for pilots and maintenance teams to reach us by redesigning our www.myaerospace.com on-stop portal, developing easy-to-use mobile apps and creating a new technical operations team.


 - 

We continued to aggressively pursue action items identified by the GCC, closing more customer issues over the last year.








We encourage you to complete the upcoming industry surveys in Aviation International News and Professional Pilot, to give us your candid feedback through the Honeywell Net Promoter Score survey and to reach out directly to the GCC &lt;https://commerce.honeywell.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/CommitteeDisplayCmd?storeId=10651&amp;segment=Business%20And%20General%20Aviation&amp;committee=Global%20Customer%20Committee&gt;.  As we begin our second century in aerospace, we&apos;re all about making it easier for you to do business with Honeywell.

We are listening.
