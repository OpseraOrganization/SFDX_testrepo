    <subject>Honeywell Wants Your Input | Supplier Readiness Assessment</subject>
    <textOnly>Honeywell is accelerating New Product Introduction (NPI) development by working to dramatically reduce development cycle time and sustain reduced lead times for new parts entering production. This transformation is a key opportunity for both Honeywell and our suppliers to better serve our customers through increased speed to market, getting world-class products in the hands of our customers faster than ever before. 

 To make this possible, we are counting on our supply base to play a strategic role in our mutual success. To help us determine supplier readiness, please take a moment to complete this short 7 question survey &lt;[[https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/BXW3BWS]]&gt;, and a Honeywell representative will contact you to discuss the details of this initiative. 

 Thank you in advance for your participation.
