    <subject>Meet Primus Epic for Dassault EASy II Upgrade</subject>
    <textOnly>There are some things that we can’t control, like global disruptions that keep us from flying. 

But there are others we can, like making the most of downtime to add important upgrades – and Honeywell and Dassault Aircraft Services are there to help you! 
 
Meet Primus Epic EASy II - a software and hardware upgrade that provides the most advanced 
technologies in safety, situational awareness and enhanced navigation capabilities. 
 
The displays offer scalable window views so charts, maps and electronic engine instrumentation images can be presented for easier viewing. 

The system allows for the integration of aircraft utilities and fly-by-wire technologies, while also offering reductions in weight, wire count and power consumption.
