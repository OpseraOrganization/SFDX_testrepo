    <subject>News about our Honeywell Houston, Texas facility</subject>

Dear Customer, 

As part of our normal business process, Honeywell continually looks for ways to better serve customers more efficiently and cost-effectively. After an extensive evaluation, we have decided to close our repair and overhaul facility in Houston, Texas by March 2020. Most of the repair and overhaul work will move to the Honeywell facility in Memphis, Tennessee. 

As the Memphis site already does similar work, we expect to start redirecting orders quickly, many by the end of the year. We expect this transition to be seamless for you and do not anticipate any disruptions to your orders. We have established a dedicated transition team to manage the transition process and ensure there is no break in service or shipments during this period. Our commitment to customer service does not wane during a transition. 

Although this change does not impact you immediately, we do anticipate changes or actions that will need to be completed in the coming months. We will certainly keep you updated on any changes or actions as they become necessary. 

In the meantime, if you have any questions, please contact your customer service representative. As always, we will continue to work to provide the quality and service that you deserve. 

Sincerely, 

Customer and Product Support
