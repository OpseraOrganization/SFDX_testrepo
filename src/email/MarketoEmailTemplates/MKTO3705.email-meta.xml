Do you know the cost of repairing your avionics in your cockpit, environmental systems, cabin pressure control systems, and other valuable and critical aircraft components? Are you prepared to cover the costs of unscheduled failures and keep your aircraft flight ready?
Take the uncertainty out of repair and maintenance costs! A fixed-price maintenance service plan for avionics from Honeywell guarantees that your repair bills won’t exceed your budget. 

So, how does Honeywell’s Maintenance Service Plan for Avionics compare to repair costs? With minor repairs costing approximately $50,000, repairs to your aircraft&apos;s avionics systems can be very expensive or catch you off guard. With our MSP Avionics program you can have peace of mind knowing you&apos;re covered by a fixed rate plan that helps you:



	- Avoid unplanned maintenance costs
	- Avoid downtime
	- Avoid unnecessary stress
