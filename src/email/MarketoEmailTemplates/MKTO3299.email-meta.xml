Hi {{lead.First Name:default=edit me}},

Still using a walking crew to inspect your power lines? Improve worker safety and increase efficiency with Honeywell’s drone inspection and data analytics service &lt;[[https://aerospace.honeywell.com/uav]]&gt;. 

Honeywell’s drone inspection and data analytics service provides a cost-effective and safe solution for utility companies. It requires less time than using a walking crew and provides better data quality than inspections conducted by helicopters.

Once the inspection is over, our proprietary data analytics software scans thousands of images collected during a typical inspection to detect cracks, pole rot, vegetation encroachment and more. It then distills those images down to only those assets which require monitoring or inspection, saving you time and money. 

A recent 150-mile inspection captured 168,000 images. After our analytics, the customer was presented with only 25 vegetation encroachment issue images and only 68 hardware related issues in less than two weeks which resulted in a 1,800% reduction in data workload. 

Improve safety and save money with Honeywell’s UAV inspection services. For more information or to speak to one of our regional technical managers, please contact us below.
