Take Connectivity to New Heights with JetWave™

Traveling doesn’t have to mean getting behind on work or what’s happening at home, and if your Wi-Fi solution is powered by JetWave, Honeywell’s premier in-flight connectivity solution, it’s easier than ever to stay connected.

Powered by Inmarsat’s fast and reliable Jet ConneX service &lt;[[https://aerospace.honeywell.com/en/~/media/aerospace/files/infographics/jetconnex_v3-ig.pdf]]&gt;, JetWave gives you the ultimate in-flight entertainment experience. Whether you need to download large attachments, videoconference with colleagues or customers, or stay connected with friends and family, JetWave allows you to experience the same connectivity you would at home or at the office with reliable Wi-Fi on the tarmac and at 30,000 feet. 

Are you ready to upgrade your in-flight experience? Act now to take advantage of recently reduced pricing when you install JetWave by December 2019, plus be sure to ask about Honeywell&apos;s new pay-as-you-go plan for Inmarsat Jet ConneX.
