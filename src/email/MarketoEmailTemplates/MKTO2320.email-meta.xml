GODIRECT LAUNCHES NEW FANS TESTING CAPABILITY
Dear Valued Channel Partner: 
 
We are pleased to announce that business and general aviation operators now have access to future air navigation system (FANS) testing as part of their Honeywell GoDirect™ Datalink &lt;[[https://aerospace.honeywell.com/en/services/aerospace-services/godirect-datalink]]&gt; service.


The new built-in tool enables operators to test the system on their aircraft after installation to ensure they have access to efficient satellite communication and navigation before takeoff. This service is free to GoDirect Flight Service customers.  


Honeywell&apos;s datalink services include free text messaging, pre-departure clearances (PDC), oceanic clearances, terminal weather information for pilots (TWIP), controller pilot datalink communication (CPDLC), custom shortcodes and many others. 

For more information, please contact your dealer sales manager or Honeywell&apos;s flight services support team at 888-634-3330/+1-602-365-7020 or flightservices@honeywell.com &lt;[[mailto:flightservices@honeywell.com]]&gt;. 


Sincerely,
