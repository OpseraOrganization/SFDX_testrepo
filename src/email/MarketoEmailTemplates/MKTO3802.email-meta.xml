Compliance costs less and takes less time

It’s time to stop worrying about Automatic Dependent Surveillance Broadcast compliance. Let Honeywell and Pro Star Aviation take the worry out of compliance with a complete solution for your Primus II-equipped aircraft. 

Contact Pro Star Aviation &lt;[[http://prostaraviation.com/]]&gt; today to learn about our special pricing and trade in allowances that will make the modification faster and more affordable. Pro Star Aviation can complete the modification in just seven days and if you’re too tied up to visit them in New Hampshire, Pro Star Aviation will come to you with their signature “on-the-fly” service. 

Visit the Pro Star Aviation website for details. But do it today because slots are filling up and the longer you wait, the greater the chances that you’ll experience extended downtime while your aircraft is being outfitted.
