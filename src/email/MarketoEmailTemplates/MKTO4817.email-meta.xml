The Future is Cleaner Air Travel
By David Rogers, Program Pilot, Honeywell



 


Six months ago, no one could have imagined the way life would look today. Worldwide economies shut down, passenger air travel came to a screeching halt and one of the most booming segments of the U.S. economy looked like it may never recover. Speculation about the return of aviation has been all over the map, including estimates from the end of the year to three or five years out. 

Fast forward a few months and things appear to finally be slowly trending upwards. Business and general aviation appear to be returning more quickly than airline travel but both appear to finally be moving in a positive direction. While we don’t know when passenger travel will return to normal, one thing we do know is protecting passengers and crew is becoming more of a priority than ever. Cockpit and cabin sterilization will become an essential part of aviation operations. 

Honeywell is there to help, creating products that enhance confidence through the entire journey. We apply our decades of experience producing personal protective equipment, aircraft systems and building-management technologies. Listen to Becky Sidelinger, &lt;[[https://www.honeywell.com/en-us/tech-forum#register]]&gt; President of the Mechanical Systems &amp; Components business in Honeywell Aerospace as she presented on our current and upcoming solutions for cleaner air travel (Honeywell Tech Forum registration required to access the presentation – once registered, 
visit the Aerospace section). Click here &lt;[[mailto:Perry.Pelitera@Honeywell.com]]&gt; to speak to Perry Pelitera, Inside Sales Manager, about our solutions for cleaner air travel or visit the Safety Shop &lt;[[https://www.honeywell.com/en-us/shop/safety]]&gt; for more information on our personal 
protective equipment.
