    <textOnly>Hi {{lead.First Name:default=there}}, 

Aside from our current trade-in promotion, did you know that by upgrading to Laseref IV, you can actually lower your cost of ownership? 

 This Laseref IV is lighter, more reliable, 
offers standard communication bus digital outputs and improved maintenance, which provides the lowest cost of ownership for inertial reference systems 

 Iâ€™d love to chat with you more about why many of our customers have made the switch already. 

 Is there a day/time that works best for you for us to connect? 

 I look forward to hearing from you. 

 Sincerely, 

{{lead.ABM Sales Rep:default=Perry Pelitera}}
