Hello {!Contact.FirstName},

It looks like we were able to work together to solve this one!

But before we close your AOG case, we want to make sure you have everything you need. If there’s more work to do, let us know and we’ll get it done. Otherwise we’ll close it and look forward to working with you again next time!

Here’s your summary:
