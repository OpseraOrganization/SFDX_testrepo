    <subject>Latest Update on our Anniston, Alabama Site</subject>
    <textOnly>&lt;[[https://aerospace.honeywell.com/]]&gt;

Dear Customer,
 
Thank you for your patience as we continue our efforts to get the Honeywell Anniston, Alabama facility operating again after sustaining storm damage on August 14th. 
 
Between August 30th and September 5th, the site will resume work on customer units that were in process prior to the storm. During this period, where capability exists at other repair locations, we ask that you continue to divert your product to alternative repair sites. Please reference the MyAerospace Repair Capabilities &lt;[[http://goaero.honeywell.com/z0hH2Gq0005IZ1HjQFl0X00]]&gt; application to determine which Honeywell site has the appropriate capability.
 
Beginning September 6th, the Anniston site will be capable of receiving new customer units for repair. Estimated ship dates will be available by September 6th for units that are already in the repair process.  
 
We are diligently working towards full recovery as soon as possible. If there are any changes to this plan, we will update you immediately. We will provide another update on or before August 30th.
 
Thank you for your continued business and understanding.


Thank you for your business,
Honeywell Aerospace Customer &amp; Product Support
