The final countdown for 2020 Mandates compliance has begun, and a recent study by Duncan Aviation estimates that 3,694 business jets will miss the deadline due in part to maintenance capacity issues!
Don’t put off your upgrades and risk sitting on the ground in 2020, or incurring higher costs.
Duncan Aviation, a Honeywell Authorized Service Center, still has capacity at several locations across the U.S., but space is limited and filling fast! Contact Duncan Aviation today to schedule a time for your upgrade!
