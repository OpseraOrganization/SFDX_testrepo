    <subject>We want to hear from you | 2020 AIN Support Survey</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Valued Customer}}, 

I want to thank you and everyone who has recently participated in the 2020 Aviation International News (AIN) Product Support Survey &lt;[[https://www.ainonline.com/productsupport/?c=login]]&gt;. If you have not completed the survey, I encourage you to participate before June 12, 2020. The feedback gained through the survey will help us monitor our strengths and successes and, more importantly, identify areas for continued improvement and investment. 

 When completing the 2020 AIN Survey, please consider some of steps we’ve taken, based on your feedback, to make it easier to work with Honeywell in the last 12 months.
