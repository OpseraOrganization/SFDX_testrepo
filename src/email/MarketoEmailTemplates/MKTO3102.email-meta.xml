Take Advantage of Tax Incentives and Upgrade to JetWave


Honeywell’s JetWave™ gives you the best Wi-Fi experience in the air. JetWave lets you download huge files, videoconference with colleagues or customers, and video chat with friends and family – on the tarmac or at 25,000 feet. Only JetWave gives you an onboard Wi-Fi experience that is as good as you get at home or the office.

Recent changes to U.S. tax rules that allow you to write off up to 100% of equipment purchases for business aircraft, including JetWave. The revised code means now is the perfect time to add Honeywell&apos;s JetWave high-speed Wi-fi to make your flight time more productive.

Treat yourself to more reliable in-flight Wi-Fi this holiday season. Schedule your upgrade with StandardAero today.
