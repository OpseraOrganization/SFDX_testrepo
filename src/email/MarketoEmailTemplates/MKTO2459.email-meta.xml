PART NUMBER CHANGE NOTIFICATION
Dear Customer,

We’re constantly looking for ways to improve the efficiency of the processes you use to order parts from Honeywell. Right now, we’re updating our ordering systems to eliminate duplicate part numbers and ensure that we’re using a consistent part-number format.
Please update your systems to use the part numbers shown in the chart below to place an order with Honeywell. Please note that only the part number format has changed. No changes are being made to the part or to catalog pricing.

Based on your company&apos;s records, we have identified the following replacement part numbers:





Previous Part Numbers

{{lead.Old Part Number:default=edit me}}
{{lead.New Part Number:default=edit me}}




If you have questions, please contact your Customer Support Representative.
