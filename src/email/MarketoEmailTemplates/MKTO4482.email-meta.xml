    <subject>Honeywell Aerospace News About Cabin Management Systems</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear Customer, 

As previously communicated, our Honeywell Cabin Management Systems (CMS) business (formerly known as Baker Electronics) is migrating to the SAP Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) environment in July 2020. As we near our ERP migration date, we would like to remind you of few key details. 

ERP Migration is scheduled to occur from June 27, 2020 through July 7, 2020. During this time, Honeywell will temporarily halt shipments and inductions for the Cabin Management Systems products. 

What to expect: 



	- Aircraft-On-Ground (AOG) Support: We will continue to accommodate critical shipments such as an AOG, until our new system is operational. There is no change in your process, please continue to use the AOG desk &lt;[[https://aerospace.honeywell.com/en/services-and-support/aircraft-on-ground]]&gt; as your first point of contact.
	- Cabin Management System orders that arrive at the Honeywell Clearwater site during this transition period will be held in receiving inspection to be inducted post transition.
	- Cabin Management System shipments will halt temporarily during this transition.


We are committed to providing you with world-class support. If you have questions or concerns, please contact us directly: CabinMGMTRepairs@Honeywell.com &lt;[[mailto:CabinMGMTRepairs@Honeywell.com]]&gt; (repairs) or CabinMGMTSales@Honeywell.com &lt;[[mailto:CabinMGMTSales@Honeywell.com]]&gt; (new part orders).
Sincerely, 

 Honeywell Aerospace
