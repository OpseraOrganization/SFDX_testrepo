With the closing of 2018, we want to thank you for being a valued BendixKing customer, and look forward to providing you more services in 2019. 
 
 Earlier this year, we expanded our BendixKing Authorized Repair Partner &lt;[[https://dealers.bendixking.com/Dealer-Search/Dealer-Directory]]&gt; network worldwide. These exceptional support partners offer the same quality of service and expertise that we maintain at our factory in Olathe. Please visit our website &lt;[[https://dealers.bendixking.com/Dealer-Search/Dealer-Directory]]&gt; to find an authorized partner near you. 
 
 Our Wingman Services &lt;[[https://wingmanservices.bendixking.com/wingman/Home.do]]&gt; team sent a notice that there is a shortage of KMD database cards; please send the old cards back when renewing your subscription. For more information or to contact wingman services, email DSA@honeywell.com &lt;[[mailto:DSA@honeywell.com]]&gt;.

 On behalf of the entire BendixKing organization, Wingman Services and your BendixKing Authorized Repair Partners, we wish you and your families a very 
safe and happiest of holidays.</textOnly>
