    <textOnly>Dear Customer, 

As you are aware, it was necessary to postpone our previously scheduled Operator Conferences until later in 2020. Since we don’t have the opportunity to meet in person during this time, I’m pleased to announce our Virtual Operator Conference Webinar. 

The Virtual Operator Conference will cover topics that include &lt;[[https://pages3.honeywell.com/rs/641-QIX-912/images/Virtual_Operator_Conference_Agenda.pdf]]&gt;: Mechanical and Avionics systems product and services hot topics, Customer &amp; Product Support self-service/portal updates, customer experience 
improvement activities, and other technological changes we have implemented based on your feedback.

You are cordially invited, along with your colleagues, to join us online on May 14, 2020, at 10:00 AM PDT / 9:00 AM MDT.

The Honeywell support team is looking forward to meeting you through our Virtual Operator Conference webinar. Stay tuned for more webinars to be announced shortly.
