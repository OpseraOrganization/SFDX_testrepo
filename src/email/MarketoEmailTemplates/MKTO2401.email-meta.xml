    <subject>HAT Increases Support for B737NG Operators</subject>
    <textOnly>&lt;[[https://aerospace.honeywell.com/]]&gt;

Dear Customers,



Honeywell Aerospace Trading (HAT) continues to expand its inventory of B737NG Used Serviceable Material in order to support its customer base. 


HAT recently acquired all of the airframe component inventory from B737-700 aircraft MSN 30275. The airframe components will be re-certified and available for sale or exchange from the new Honeywell Distribution Center in Phoenix, Arizona.

This strategic acquisition follows prior B737NG inventory investments from 5 airframes in 2016, enabling HAT to provide complete inventory support to its B737NG customers. 

HAT is a growing provider of Used Serviceable Material to aircraft operators world-wide, having a global sales force and stocking locations in Europe and North America.
