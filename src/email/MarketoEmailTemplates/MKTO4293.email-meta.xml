    <subject>Trade-in your old MCDU for the new MCDU-R</subject>
    <textOnly>Honeywell has teamed up with JR Tech (Guangzhou) Co. Ltd to provide a one-stop-shop Gulfstream MCDU-R inventory management and distribution service for customers in the Asia-Pacific region. This joint-service enables them to purchase and trade in MCDUs minimizing leadtime and cost procuring such parts in-region.

 This is an on-wing upgradable option, so no Supplementary Type Certificate (STC) is required but an authorized engineer needs to install this unit.

 BACKGROUND

 The MCDU-1 and MCDU-2 are both deemed Beyond Economic Repair 
(BER) and facing obsolescence as Honeywell have exhausted the supply of video assembly and processor cards, impacting repairs and support for them. This is detailed in SIL D201604000016 for the MCDU-1 and SIL D201502000021 for the MCDU-2.

 All part numbers for the MCDU-1 and MCDU-2 have been removed from MSP Avionics coverage and Honeywell is no longer offering the option to purchase MCDU-R MSP Avionics Extended coverage.

 The latest version MCDU-R is a form, fit, function replacement for the current MCDU-1 and 
MCDU-2.
