JetWave™ SATCOM is the Perfect Fit for Business Aviation 
It’s easier than ever to move up to the best Wi-Fi flying – Honeywell’s breakthrough JetWave™ satellite communications system. That’s because JetWave was designed for fast, easy installation in your business aircraft. In fact, most installations are completed in about two weeks, so you can fold your SATCOM upgrade into a scheduled major service interval.

JetWave uses either a tail-mounted antenna, for mid-size business jets, or a fuselage-mounted version for larger aircraft. Either way, it’s an easy fit since the JetWave antenna replaces your current L-band or Ku-band antenna. There’s room to spare under your current radome. 

All this makes JetWave the perfect fit your airplane and a perfect fit for your lifestyle. No connected aircraft solution comes closer to providing you an in-flight experience comparable to the Wi-Fi you use at your office or home. 

With Honeywell hardware and the JetConneX Ka-band network from Inmarsat you’ve got everything you need to stay connected, productive and entertained with reliable broadband access, anywhere you fly.
