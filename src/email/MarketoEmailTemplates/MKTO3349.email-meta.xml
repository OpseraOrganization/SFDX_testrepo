UPDATE YOUR SYSTEMS TO ORDER HONEYWELL&apos;S DISPLAYS
Dear Customer:
You have received this email because our records indicate that this information is relevant to you. If you no longer need this information, please click here &lt;[[https://pages3.honeywell.com/Distribution-Update.html]]&gt; to update your information.

As part of Honeywell’s normal business process, we continually evaluate our business lines to determine how they fit into the long-term strategy. In March 2018, we announced an exclusive licensing agreement 
with Ontic, a subsidiary of BBA Aviation, for the manufacturing and servicing of our Urbana, Ohio-based displays product line. This includes products sold through Grimes Lighting and BendixKing.   
This agreement ends both Honeywell’s production and repair work for these displays. A review of past orders indicates that you have placed production or repair orders for impacted part numbers. This list is available here &lt;https://pages3.honeywell.com/rs/641-QIX-912/images/DisplaysLRUList_July2018.pdf&gt;.  
To minimize issues or delays, please follow these guidelines and actions.

New Original Equipment Orders: 


	- Effective July 20, orders for these displays will no longer be accepted by Honeywell. 
	- Effective July 23, orders for these displays should be placed with Ontic.



Existing Original Equipment Orders: 


	- 
Existing orders due before January 2, 2019 will ship from Honeywell with a Honeywell certificate of compliance. 

	- 
Existing orders due after January 2, 2019 will ship from Ontic with an Ontic certificate of compliance. 




Original Equipment Information: 


	- Honeywell will make every effort to fulfil orders placed between now and July 20.
	- Some long lead orders may require a novation agreement to Ontic. In this event, Honeywell will work closely with all parties to coordinate that activity.


Repair Orders: 


	- 
Repairs currently performed at Renton will transition August 10.



	- Effective August 13, repair orders should be placed with Ontic. 


	- 
Repairs currently performed at Urbana will transition November 1. 



	- 
Effective November 2, repair orders should be placed with Ontic.

Honeywell will make every effort to fulfil orders placed by the above dates. If an issue arises that prevents this, we will work closely with all parties to coordinate the repair completion through purchase order novation.
