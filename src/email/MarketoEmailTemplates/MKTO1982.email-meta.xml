Hello {{lead.First Name:default=Customer}},



There are many important reasons you should schedule your FMS 6.1 upgrade well before Dec. 31, 2018 and we want to make sure you know why we think you should upgrade in 2017: 




	- Starting December 31, 2018, customers who do not upgrade to FMS 6.1 will incur a 20% increase in addition to their annual, navigation database premium. 

	- In 2019, the increase will go from 20% to 30%.

	- And in 2020, the increase will go up to 50%




By 2020, you will have paid more in fees than you would’ve to get the benefits of FMS 6.1. Upgrade today to avoid these fees, meet the upcoming mandates, access more airports and enjoy a safer overall flying experience.







UPGRADE TODAY &lt;[[https://pages3.honeywell.com/FMSNotice_2017.html]]&gt;</textOnly>
