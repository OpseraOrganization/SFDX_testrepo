The final countdown for 2020 Mandates compliance has begun, and in many cases if you haven&apos;t scheduled your updates by July 2019, you won&apos;t get in before the deadline. 
Don’t put off your upgrades and risk sitting on the ground in 2020, or incurring higher costs.
Spirit Aeronautics &lt;[[http://www.spiritaeronautics.com/]]&gt; still has capacity for ADS-B upgrades, but space is limited and filling fast! Click below to contact Spirit Aeronautics today to schedule a time for your upgrade!
