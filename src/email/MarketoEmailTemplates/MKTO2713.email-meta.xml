Thanks to Pro Star Aviation and Honeywell’s wireless data LAN management unit (DLMU-W) upgrade, Falcon and Gulfstream business jet owners can improve dispatch reliability and get their aircraft off the ground quicker.

Honeywell’s DLMU-W replaces your current data loader and data LAN management unit with a wireless data loader so that your pilots can load critical flight information instead of having a maintenance technician do it.

And the best part? You won’t need to worry about charging your laptop, downloading external media or arranging for long cables—it’s all wireless!

Improve flight operations and start downloading data more efficiently. Contact us today to speak to an expert at Pro Star Aviation about Honeywell’s DLMU-W upgrade.
