    <subject>Re: Where will you park your grounded aircraft?</subject>

Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Customer}},


A grounded plane without ADS-B Out in 2020 will feel like owning a car that broke down on the side of the road.

As you’ve researched the costs of adding ADS-B Out to your aircraft, you may be contemplating selling your aircraft rather than upgrading. However, if you do not upgrade, you not only risk losing the current market value but your aircraft will be parked.

According to GAMA &lt;[[http://www.ainonline.com/aviation-news/business-aviation/2017-06-08/residual-values-drop-non-ads-b-equipped-aircraft]]&gt;, the value of your asset is going to start dropping even before 2020 if you don’t have a slot to upgrade.

So why wait any longer? Protect your investment whether you intend to sell your aircraft or keep it. Contact Honeywell today and we will connect you to one of our authorized dealers near you.
