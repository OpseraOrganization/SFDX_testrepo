Honeywell&apos;s next generation Health Usage and Monitoring System (HUMS) code-name RECON™ is available! HUMS measures the health and performance of critical components in helicopters, 
increasing safety and reducing operational and maintenance cost.
 
By monitoring vibration at numerous points throughout the drivetrain, and pinpointing mechanical faults before they become failures. HUMS provides actionable information that helps operators make informed maintenance decisions.

RECON is eight times faster than its 
predecessor systems. This reduces flight-test data acquisition time by 85%. RECON also provides operators HUMS data where and when they need it – inflight, post-flight, in the hangar and at an enterprise level.
