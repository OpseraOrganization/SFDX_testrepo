    <subject>URGENT, PLEASE READ â€“ Honeywell 2020 Operators Conference</subject>
    <textOnly>All, 

To protect the health and safety of our employees and customers, Honeywell is postponing our Operators Conference in Prague next week. We made this decision out of an abundance of caution based on the growing number of confirmed COVID-19 coronavirus cases in Europe, the Middle East and elsewhere in the regions. 

Please cancel any travel plans as it relates to this event immediately. We plan to reschedule this event for later in the year but as of now, cannot commit to a specific date or location.

We realize this is a burden to our customers, but again our decision is based on prioritizing the health of everyone involved. 

Please contact you Honeywell Customer Service Manager or Field Service Engineer with any questions.


Thanks,

Honeywell Events Team</textOnly>
