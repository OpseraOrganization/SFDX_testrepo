    <subject>Process Update: Declared Values on Carrier Labels</subject>
    <textOnly>At Honeywell Aerospace, one of our driving priorities is ensuring our customers are provided top of the line service in all ways, including fast and convenient shipping for exchanges and returns. In order to facilitate this activity, customers are invited to utilize Honeywell’s own carrier accounts within their preferred shipping platform. 

 Should you, as a customer, produce carrier labels for returning product, regardless of reason, to a Honeywell facility, please carefully review the below information and amend your practices as necessary, if applicable. 

 What do we ask you to be aware of? 
 Carriers, such as DHL, UPS, and FDX, prompt users to enter a declared value when creating a shipping label through their websites. This value is used to calculate the cost of insurance to cover damage or loss while in transit, known as liability coverage. 

 Why does Honeywell not wish to purchase liability coverage?
 Honeywell holds a global blanket insurance policy through an outside broker. This global policy covers all shipments for which Honeywell is contractually obligated to insure. Because we hold this blanket policy, we do not need to purchase additional insurance directly through our carriers. 

 What action do we ask of our customers?
 If you process carrier labels through a carrier’s website, or in carrier-owned assets, such as UPS WorldShip or FedEx ShipStation machines, the Declared Value field should be left blank. Please refer to the images below to ensure that when preparing a carrier label on a Honeywell account, additional insurance will not be purchased in error.
