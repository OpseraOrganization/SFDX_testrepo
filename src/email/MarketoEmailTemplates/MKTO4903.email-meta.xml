    <subject>Thank you for your microelectronic inquiry</subject>
    <textOnly>Hello! 

 My name is Tom and I’m the technical sales manager for Honeywell’s microelectronic portfolio. I&apos;m excited that you are considering our products for your next project. 

 To help us best serve you, please take a minute to tell us a little more about your inquiry: 



	- What is your role?
	- Is your question technical (product selection / data sheet) or transactional (quote / lead time)?


Thanks for your time.
