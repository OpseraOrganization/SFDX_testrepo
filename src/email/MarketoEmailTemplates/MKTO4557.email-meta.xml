    <textOnly>There’s nothing like the urgent call from the cabin &lt;[[https://aerospace.honeywell.com/en/learn/about-us/blogs/2019/04/how-to-avoid-the-dreaded-call-from-the-cabin?utm_source=email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=20_honeywellforge_bga&amp;utm_content=nurture]]&gt; to quicken the pulse of everyone in the flight 
department. The Wi-Fi is down on the corporate jet and its C-level passengers can’t connect with the big client, the major investor or the support team at the home office. 

Honeywell Forge helps you avoid that call. Honeywell Forge is our new end-to-end cabin connectivity and flight services platform that gives you the tools you need to make sure passengers can get connected, stay connected and achieve their objectives. 

With Honeywell Forge and our industry-leading JetWave satellite communications systems, the flight department has access to in-flight Wi-Fi and SATCOM status information, from the moment of connection pre-takeoff and through every phase of flight. Honeywell Forge identifies problems with visual cues and provides guidance on how issues can be resolved.
