HONEYWELL – SUPPLIER FEEDBACK &amp; CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT 
 PAUL EBERTZ  | CHIEF PROCUREMENT OFFICER, HONEYWELL AEROSPACE 
 
 Greetings to our Supplier Partners! 
 
 Honeywell Aerospace is committed to deliver on time, with high quality, to our customers. In support of this commitment, we ask that you continue to challenge yourselves to better understand how you can meet Honeywell Aerospace’s delivery &amp; quality requirements. Our suppliers are critical in enabling us meet and exceed our joint end customers’ expectations.  
 
 As you know, we launched our first digital survey to all suppliers at the end of 2018, requesting feedback as to how we can better help enable our mutual success. Thank you to the many suppliers that took that time to provide thoughtful responses to this survey.  
 
 Based on your feedback, it is clear there is room for improvement in multiple areas, and we are committed to driving positive change. We have now launched efforts to address key elements of this feedback with both near-term and longer term horizons. We will be sharing more specifics with you as we make progress on these items throughout 2019. 
 
 Thank you again for your continued support.
