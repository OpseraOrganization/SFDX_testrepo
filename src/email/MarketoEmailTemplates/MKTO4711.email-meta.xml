    <subject>Trade-in Credit for Laseref IV Reduced</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi {{lead.First Name:default=there}}, 

 Recently, Honeywell announced that the trade-in credit has been reduced by 50% for existing Laseref systems in 2021. 

 As a helpful reminder, when you order a LASEREF IV in 2020, you’ll receive a trade-in credit with the return of each LASEREF II and LASEREF III. 

 In you recall, in December we stopped supporting older versions of our Laseref inertial reference systems to be able to provide the highest level of customer service and product support for customers using our Laseref IV &lt;[[https://aerospace.honeywell.com/content/dam/aero/en-us/documents/learn/products/navigation-and-radios/brochures/N61-2495-000-000_LASEREF_IV_Retrofit_Program-bro.pdf?download=true]]&gt;. 

 Because your aircraft is currently equipped with a system we no longer support, I’d like to help you better understand how you can upgrade to Laseref IV while there’s still trade-in incentives. 

 Is there a day/time that works best for you for us to connect? 

 I look forward to hearing from you. 

 Sincerely,
