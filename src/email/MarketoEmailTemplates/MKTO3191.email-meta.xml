    <subject>Hello from Honeywell User Experience team</subject>
    <textOnly>&lt;[[https://aerospace.honeywell.com/]]&gt; Are you interested in being a part of the website development process? We have the perfect opportunity for you!

As we continue to evaluate our future MyAerospace website for both navigation and design, weâ€™ll be conducting a 1:1 session, one-hour moderated study that will take place in the next couple weeks. Our team is looking for users of MyAerospace portal to participate in this research activity. By participating in this study, you will help us determine our future path and receive a $50 American Express Gift Card for your time.
To take part, please email Claudia.Guerrero@Honeywell.com &lt;[[mailto:Claudia.Guerrero@Honeywell.com]]&gt; ASAP. We are conducting the user experience study in the week of February 18th.
We look forward to hearing from you!
Best,
