Honeywell Offers Discounts &amp; Trade-In Allowances 

This may be your last chance to upgrade your Honeywell Primus II &lt;[[https://aerospace.honeywell.com/en/products/navigation-and-sensors/primus-ii-radio-system]]&gt; – equipped aircraft to meet the 2020 ADS-B mandate – and qualify for special pricing and 
trade-in allowances that make the installation more affordable than ever. 

Honeywell and Pro Star Aviation &lt;[[http://prostaraviation.com/]]&gt; are teaming help you meet the mandate deadline of Jan. 1, 2020, at a price you can afford and with minimum downtime. Depending on the part numbers of your units, Pro Star Aviation can modify your aircraft starting at $65,000 and in just seven working days. 

They also offer on-the-fly service, providing a convenient, alternative for U.S. – based customers. 

Without this upgrade, you may find yourself unable to fly in controlled airspace in the U.S. ADS-B allows the aircraft to continually broadcast its position – aircraft identification, current position, altitude and velocity – without benefit of ground-based systems.

Slots are filling up and the longer you wait, the greater the chances that you’ll experience extended downtime while your aircraft is being outfitted.
