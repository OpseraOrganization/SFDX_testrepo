Join Honeywell’s Technical Sales Manager, Preston Dane, with host Dan Stockfisch, for our upcoming webinar: Honeywell Aspire Satcom Solutions.

Specifically for our Honeywell dealers, this webinar will present all you need to know about Satcom – Safety, FANS, CPDLC and Cabin Internet. It will also answer questions like – what’s all this satellite stuff anyway? And will Satcom be the demise of HF Radio? Join our discussions about past, present and future of Satcom. 

 After attending this webinar, you&apos;ll be well-versed on planning customer Satcom upgrades by tailoring solutions to aircraft mission requirements spanning cockpits and cabin mandates.
