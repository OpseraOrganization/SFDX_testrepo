    <subject>Invest in Mission Readiness</subject>
    <textOnly>Maintaining mission readiness requires planning, preparation and flexibility. It can often be a complex logistical challenge, ensuring that the fleet is ready to support any mission requested of it.

 It’s why Honeywell continues to expand and develop our retrofit, modification and upgrade offerings for our military customers. No matter the aircraft you fly, we have a solution to improve performance, increase reliability, lower lifecycle and maintenance costs and improve installation and/or removal time.

 Spanning transport, fighter and helicopter operations, our upgrades all have one thing in common – they are designed to improve mission-readiness



	- Variety of upgrades for UH-60s that can increase reliability by 5x, lower direct maintenance costs by 90%, and deliver improved performance by up to 33%.
	- Selection of retrofits, mods and upgrades for the C-130 that deliver increased reliability, less ground aborts, less depot repairs and, in some cases, a 75% reduction in install/removal times.


This is just a small sample of the platforms we can support and the savings that our upgrades can offer.
