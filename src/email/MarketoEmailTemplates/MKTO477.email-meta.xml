2015 Boeing 787 Fleet Team Conference – Washington















Honeywell is geared up to take on a long list of activities for you in Washington.
We’ll be there throughout the gathering to share full details on the improvements we’re making to our 787 products (many of them as a result of your feedback). Honeywell staff will also be on hand for a panel discussion on topics critical to your flight operations.
Away from the main floor and scheduled meetings, the Honeywell Balsam Room suite will be open after hours on Tuesday to welcome you in for eats, drinks and great prizes.
Best of all, we’ll take every opportunity to visit with you throughout the meetings to hear your take on what’s working, what needs more work, and how we can make your business easier, better, and more profitable.
We’ll see you in Washington!
