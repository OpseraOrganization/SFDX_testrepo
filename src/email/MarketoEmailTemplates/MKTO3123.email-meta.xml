    <subject>GoDirect Trade is Not Vanilla Ice Cream</subject>
    <textOnly>&lt;[[https://aerospace.honeywell.com/]]&gt;

Hi {{lead.First Name:default=customer}},


Ice cream parlors that only stock vanilla ice cream are very much like the generic, used parts websites that exist today. 

They offer their sellers a templated store front (vanilla), an antiquated uploading process (peanuts) and a one-size-fits-all fee structure (whipped cream). 

GoDirect Trade will never be a one-size-fits-all parts website and will be much more like your favorite ice cream parlor:



	- We give you the options (flavors) to customize your seller storefront to match your brand and company information

	- We have a variety of set-up opportunities (toppings)

	- And, we make it easy for you to upload your listings through our seller mobile app or a CSV upload (cherry on top)


When you work with us, you’ll also have access to a world-class customer support team who are dedicated to getting you up and running as quickly and conveniently as possible (hot fudge).

Enough with the ice cream comparisons – I think you get my point! 

We’re looking for buyers and sellers to join us on our journey to become the greatest aerospace marketplace to ever exist. Create your account and start shopping on GoDirect Trade today.
