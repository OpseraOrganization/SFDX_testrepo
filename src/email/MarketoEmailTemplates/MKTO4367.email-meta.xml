    <subject>Reminder: Closure of Swift 64 services on 31 December 2020</subject>
    <textOnly>Upgrade your Inmarsat Swift64 and connect to the future today with SwiftbroadBand (SBB) or Jet Connex Services from Honeywell Forge
If you haven’t already done so, now is the time to upgrade to either SBB or Jet ConneX airtime services with Honeywell Forge. This year, Swift 64 will be discontinued, and you’ll need to upgrade to the latest connectivity service package to enjoy seamless cockpit and cabin connectivity.
SwiftBroadBand 

The upgrade from Swift 64 to SBB continues to support voice and data communication services at data rates of up to 432 kbps per channel. SBB enables the on-board network to handle more simultaneous users and more demanding applications. 

JetWave and Jet ConneX 

If you are interested in a larger upgrade, you should consider a Jet ConneX airtime package with a JetWave satellite communications system. JetWave is the hardware that allows you to connect to Inmarsat’s Jet ConneX, the fastest broadband available for business aviation. Jet ConneX is the first consistent high-speed broadband service to span the world. And there is never been a better time to purchase this solution as there is special pricing through the rest of 2020. Saving you up to $150,000. 

Service plan pricing remains constant throughout the contract period, enabling easier annual operating budget management and eliminating financial surprises.
