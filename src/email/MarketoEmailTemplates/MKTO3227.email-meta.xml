Six decades after the C-130 transport entered production, the Hercules is still a mainstay of many air forces around the world. That’s because upgraded solutions have kept the aircraft relevant with enhanced safety, efficiency and mission-effectiveness.




Honeywell has a wide range of modifications, retrofits and upgrades, with an emphasis on communications and flight safety technologies. Included are broadband satellite communications systems, weather radar, Traffic Collision Avoidance Systems (TCAS) and Enhanced Ground Proximity Warning Systems (EGPWS).

We’re also helping air forces get ready to fly in civil airspace and meet government mandates for installation of automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast (ADS-B Out) capabilities on their aircraft before 2020. Book an appointment with our sales team today to learn more about our solutions for C-130.
