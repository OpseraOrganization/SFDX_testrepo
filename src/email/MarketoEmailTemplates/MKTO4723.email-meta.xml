    <subject>News about the Honeywell Coon Rapids Transition- Product Cutover Reminder</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear Honeywell Customer, 
 
 As Honeywell advised in 2019, we have decided to optimize our operations and close our Coon Rapids, Minnesota facility by Q1 2021. As a reminder, the product lines affected by this transition include: 


	- Commercial Inertial Reference Units (IRU), Data Acquisition Units (DAU), Yaw Damper, and Flame Sensors are moving to the Clearwater, FL site.
	- Digital Analog Adaptor (DAA), Air Data Computer (ADC), Air Data Management (ADM), and Fuel Probes are moving to the Deer Valley, AZ site. 
	- Control Sensor Products (CSP) have transitioned from our Golden Valley site to the Clearwater, FL site.



Action Required: This notice is to remind you of the upcoming changes required before September 28, 2020. To minimize issues or delays with the repair of your hardware, please follow these guidelines and actions. 
What to do now?


	- Prepare for upcoming transition: Review the transition schedule and impacted parts list provided above, adjust your supply plan as needed, resolve outstanding holds to minimize transition delays, and take actions to ensure internal systems are updated to reflect the correct Honeywell location on the correlating transition dates


	- Set/schedule updates to your internal ERP/MRP systems to support correct shipping destination per the table shown above


	- Update Authorized Supplier List (ASL) as needed: If Clearwater is not already on your ASL, start working to add the new supplier to your approved supplier list. If you need to conduct an on-site audit, please email your Honeywell Representative.
