Dear Customers,


StandardAero gives customers confidence knowing they’re getting the very best service when they come in for their JetWave upgrade because they provide customers with “the best internet in the sky.” 

“We wanted the best Internet in sky technology to enhance connectivity for our passengers. Working with StandardAero’s maintenance and avionics experts we selected Honeywell’s JetWave Ka-band system as the best available option on the market today. Our new JetWave system is up and running and the performance has been fantastic. We benefit from ‘on-the-ground’ speeds while operating around the globe, without having to access a patchwork of service providers.”


- Seamus Muzzulin, director of maintenance.

Schedule your upgrade with StandardAero and join the hundreds of aircraft that are flying with JetWave today.
