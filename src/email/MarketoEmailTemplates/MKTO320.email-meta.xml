    <subject>Honeywell Global Data Center - Migration Deadline June 30</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear Customer,

As a reminder, the MyGDC enhancements you&apos;ve been hearing about are now here and all users are required to complete the migration to a Honeywell ID by June 30th.  Once complete users will be able to experience account management features, access to other Honeywell online tools as well as increased online security.  If you have not already completed the migration please go to www.myGDC.com &lt;http://www.myGDC.com&gt; to begin the process now.

 

What this means:


 - Current users with a GDC ID are required to create a new Honeywell ID in order to log in to mygdc.com.
 - iPad users will need to download v 3.5 of the MyGDC app available now on the Apple store.



 

New MyGDC enhancements:


 - Single Sign On – Login once to the Honeywell Aerospace Portal or pilots.honeywell.com and switch to myGDC.com seamlessly
 - Self-management of credentials – users will be able to change password, recover forgotten password, change user information and retrieve forgotten username using our online tool
 - Improved online security



To learn more please go to www.MyGDC.com/NewID &lt;http://www.MyGDC.com/NewID&gt;, email us gfo@mygdc.com &lt;mailto:gfo@mygdc.com&gt; or phone at (888) 634-3330 or (425) 885-8100.</textOnly>
