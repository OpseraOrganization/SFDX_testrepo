Always Connected. Always in Control


In-flight connectivity is crucial for maximizing your travel time. From the moment you step on board, JetWave’s powerful connection delivers high speed internet for an in-home like Wi-Fi connection that powers all your devices. Stay in control of your business, don’t miss the big game, and even video chat throughout your entire flight.

With JetWave, your business jet can connect to Inmarsat’s Ka-band service – Jet ConneX™ - for global, reliable, high-speed Wi-Fi for seamless in-flight connectivity. Once connected, your jet will have the ability to access a whole suite of GoDirect™ apps that can help your flight crew navigate weather better, save fuel and control data usage.

And now, recent changes to U.S. tax rules allow you to write off up to 100% of equipment purchases for business aircraft, including JetWave, making this the perfect time to upgrade your in-flight Wi-Fi capabilities.

Take advantage of tax savings and get a more reliable in-flight Wi-Fi experience. Schedule your upgrade with StandardAero today.
