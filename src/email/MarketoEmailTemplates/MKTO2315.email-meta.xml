    <subject>ADS-B Mandate - Do You Have a 2020 Vision?</subject>
    <textOnly>&lt;[[https://aerospace.honeywell.com/]]&gt;

Do you have a 2020 Air Traffic Mandate Vision? 
By 2020, all aircraft operating in Europe and the U.S will be required to transmit ADS-B positioning information in compliance with DO-260B transponder standards - the deadline is January 2020 for U.S airspace*, June 2020 for European airspace*.
 
 Do you have a crystal-clear plan for securing the required hardware and upgrading your Falcon 7X aircraft in time to comply with these mandates? If not, Dassault Falcon Service and Honeywell can support with a variety of ADS-B compliant solutions which are available now!
Although the mandate deadline is still over two years away, Dassault Falcon Service and Honeywell recommend that you act now! Product availability and service center capacity will become increasingly scarce as we approach the FAA and EASA deadlines. This could impact your aircraft being updated in time. In addition by upgrading sooner you’ll be able to start reaping the benefits that other Falcon 7X operators are already enjoying in the form of more direct routings, more efficient route changes and fuel savings.
