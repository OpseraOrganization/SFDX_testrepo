Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Customer}},

A study conducted by the National Business Aviation Association 
(NBAA &lt;[[https://nbaa.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/nexa-business-aviation-and-top-performing-companies-2017.pdf]]&gt;) found that “Business aviation contributes meaningfully to a company’s enterprise value, and continues to be a powerful tool of the best-managed companies in America.”
 
 As you already know, operating a business aircraft improves your 
team&apos;s productivity, accelerates transactional closings, and boosts customer interactions resulting in improved retention and more.  But, the silent hero keeping information flowing and productivity high is the Wi-Fi connectivity system.  With Honeywell JetWaveTM, you and your passengers can tap into Inmarsat’s Jet ConneX service and experience fast and consistent 
Wi-Fi from taxi to touchdown.
 
 Within the next 15 years, 98% of aircraft will have connectivity solutions &lt;[[https://nbaa.org/aircraft-operations/communications-navigation-surveillance-cns/connectivity/]]&gt;. Boost your competitive edge with JetWave!
