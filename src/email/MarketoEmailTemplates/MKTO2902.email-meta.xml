    <textOnly>When you&apos;re looking for the best, look no further than the Ovation Select® cabin management and in-flight entertainment system from Honeywell and New United Goderich. 

With a state-of-the-art digital solution, you´ll wonder why you waited so long to throw out the outdated equipment that you no longer use on your business jet. 


Would you like to be able to watch TV or a high-definition Blu-ray movie with full surround sound on the way to your next family vacation? Need to review a presentation with your colleagues before you land? Not a problem. With Ovation Select, you can stream content from any carry-on device throughout the entire cabin. 
 
When it’s time to relax, you can enjoy news, sports, movies, gaming and music. Your media content is delivered in crisp surround sound audio and vivid HD video. The result - every seat becomes its own theatre in the sky.
 
When you need to work, you can be just as connected onboard as you are in the office, making the most of your travel time. You can receive and respond to e-mail, access the Internet, host video conferences and make phone calls.
