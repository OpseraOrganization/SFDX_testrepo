    <subject>Never Miss a moment with JetWave</subject>
    <textOnly>Traveling doesn’t have to mean missing out on life’s little moments or the action from the big game – but only if your aircraft is powered by JetWave.

 From the moment you climb aboard until you touch down and taxi, only JetWave delivers secure, high-speed business grade Wi-Fi on all your devices simultaneously, as good at the office or home. Stream live TV, follow sports, chat and videoconference and more with superior onboard Wi-Fi– both on the tarmac and at 45,000 feet, that can be installed by the Honeywell Expert at Clay Lacy Aviation. 

 Rely on Clay Lacy Aviation, an Authorized Honeywell Dealer, for factory-trained installation at a full-service FAA Repair Station in Van Nuys, California. 

 Stop fighting an unreliable Wi-Fi connection and contact Clay Lacy Aviation today to schedule your upgrade to the high level, on your Dassault Falcon, Bombardier Global or Challenger Aircraft.
