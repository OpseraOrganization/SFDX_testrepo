Best Performance, Best Deal on a Honeywell IRS

You deserve the best. That’s just what you’ll get when you choose to replace your soon-to-be-obsolete LASEREF II or LASEREF III with our latest inertial reference system for business aircraft, the LASEREF IV. 

Honeywell plans to stop supporting LASEREF II and LASEREF III on Dec. 31, 2019. To encourage you to upgrade to the peak performance and reliability of the LASEREF IV, Honeywell and Duncan Aviation are offering special pricing and a $52,500 Honeywell trade-in credit for operators who install the LASEREF IV by then. 

In addition, Duncan Aviation is also offering special pricing to operators who would like to upgrade to DU-875 and LASEREF IV at the same time.
 
Don’t delay, the Honeywell trade-in credits and special pricing will expire 12/31/2019! Contact Duncan Aviation to learn more or request a quote.
