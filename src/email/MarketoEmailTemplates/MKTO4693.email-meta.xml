    <subject>LASEREF IV Trade-in Credit with Clay Lacy – Upgrade now!</subject>
    <textOnly>The LASEREF IV is a Ring Laser Gyro (RLG) based inertial reference unit (IRU), providing Honeywell’s proven laser inertial technology in the lightest 4 MCU rack mountable package.   Reliability of the fleet of Digital Ring Laser Gyro inertial reference systems has consistently exceeded 30,000 Mean Time Between Failure and 20,000 Mean Time Between Unscheduled Removals since entry into service in 1997.   This system has been instrumental in helping operators achieve low maintenance costs and high dispatch reliability. Since December 31st, 2019, Honeywell stopped supporting LASEREF II and LASEREF III and its coverage will also end in 2020 into MSP Avionics protection plan based on contract expiration date.  Upgrade to the performance and reliability of the LASEREF IV, and keep your IRS covered into the MSP Avionics, Honeywell and Clay Lacy Aviation are offering a trade-in credit for operators who install the new LASEREF IV.
