    <textOnly>Automation and the Flight Envelope


Date: Thursday, March 26, 7-8pm EDT 
 
 Chances are, your autopilot flies much closer to the edges of your aircraft’s flight envelope than you do with the yoke in your hands. But which is better? This webinar will review the levels of automation, visual cues, and strategies for aligning your aircraft’s automation with phases of flight. 

 Join SocialFlight’s Jeff Simon and BendixKing’s Andrew Barker and Mariellen Couppee to explore the subject, including how the BendixKing’s newest autopilot, the AeroCruze 230, fits into the equation. 

 They will provide the maintenance, builder, production as well as flight instructor’s point of view. 

 Topics include:



	- Automation and the Envelope
	- Overview and Differences
	- The Mindset of the Box
	- Walk-through Scenarios
