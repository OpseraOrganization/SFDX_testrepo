    <subject>How to Avoid Unplanned Aircraft Maintenance Costs</subject>
    <textOnly>While it is true that today’s aircraft equipment is more reliable than ever, it is also becoming more complex. An unplanned failure can ruin your entire budget. We’ve seen customers spend as much as six figures replacing a component, when they could have covered the cost of the cockpit or whole system at a fraction of the cost with Honeywell’s Maintenance Service Plan (MSP).

 For more than forty years, Honeywell has offered aftermarket maintenance service plans that give operators peace of mind and help them protect their sizeable investments with fixed pricing plans. This is based on important facts such as flying hours and engine use. Select the right coverage option for your unique needs!

 Take the guesswork out of determining your annual maintenance budget. Contact Corporate Jet Support and request a quote today.
