Do you have a 2020 Vision?

Dear {{lead.First Name:default=edit me}} {{lead.Last Name:default=Valued Customer}}, 



By 2020, all aircraft operating in Europe and the U.S will be required to transmit ADS-B positioning information in compliance with DO-260B transponder standards - the deadline is 01 January 2020 for U.S airspace* and 07 June 2020 for European airspace*.
 
 Do you have a crystal-clear plan for ensuring your Pilatus PC-12NG aircraft is upgraded in time to comply with these mandates? If not, Honeywell can help. We are offering a spares exchange (SPEX) option upgrade for Pilatus PC-12NG aircraft currently equipped with KXP 2290 non-ADS-B Transponder. Access to the SPEX exchange pool will facilitate the rapid exchange of your transponder and minimize any aircraft downtime during the upgrade.

TALK TO OUR SPECIALISTS TODAY AND DEVELOP YOUR 2020 VISION.
