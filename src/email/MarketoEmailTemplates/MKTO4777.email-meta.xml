    <subject>Honeywell Aerospace News About Support of the 777-Cargo Smoke Detectors</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear Honeywell Customer, 

 As communicated initially in July 2019, Honeywell entered into a licensing agreement with AbelConn to service our cargo smoke detector product line used on the passenger Boeing 777 aircraft. AbelConn, a Celestica company, is committed to servicing these products and is uniquely qualified to address your support needs as the primary source of manufacturing and repair for these smoke detector products for Honeywell since 2016. 
Please note: In an effort to better support our customers, Honeywell has decided to extend the transition period for Repair and Overhaul services for part numbers 2119835-6, 2119835-7, 2118860-4, and 2119042-1. In Mid-October, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) will be conducting the Part 145 audit to certify the AbelConn New Hope, Minnesota site for operator repairs.
