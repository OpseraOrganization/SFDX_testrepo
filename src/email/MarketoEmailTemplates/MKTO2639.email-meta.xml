We have the affordable solution for your Cessna CitationJet 

There’s no better time than NOW to upgrade your aircraft! You have flexibility and choice to upgrade your aircraft, but the opportunity lessens the longer you postpone. Experts predict 50%+ price increases on components and installation!

Why install BendixKing´s ADS-B Upgrade?

Installation of the KT 74 transponders and panel overlay is a slide-and-replace upgrade with no required rack or wiring connector modifications, significantly reducing 
installation costs and aircraft downtime.

The upgrade replaces the current KT 70 transponders and includes two custom-designed KT 74 ADS-B Out transponders, a new CNI 5000 &lt;[[https://bendixking.com/en/products/cni-5000]]&gt; panel overlay, and an optional GPS 
receiver and Wi-Fi module that provide ADS-B In capability (weather and traffic information).

The CNI 5000 ADS-B upgrade offers CitationJet owners and operators a reasonably-priced solution that is very quick to install and maintains the aesthetics of the instrument panel.
