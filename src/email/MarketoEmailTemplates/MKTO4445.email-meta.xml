    <textOnly>Best Performance on a Honeywell Inertial Reference System
Best performance is what you’ll get when you choose to replace your obsolete inertial reference system for the new LASEREF IV. 
 
 Honeywell is no longer supporting the aging LASEREF II and III as of Dec. 31, 2019. To encourage you to upgrade to the best performance and reliability of the LASEREF IV, Honeywell and Pro Star Aviation are offering a trade-in credit for operators who install the new inertial reference system by the end of 2020. 
 
 
This new configuration represents a significant advancement in inertial reference system technology. It offers a 30% improvement in reliability, 35% weight reduction, uses considerably less power and has the lowest cost of ownership of any inertial reference system flying today!
Upgrade now! Contact Pro Star Aviation to learn more or request a quote.
