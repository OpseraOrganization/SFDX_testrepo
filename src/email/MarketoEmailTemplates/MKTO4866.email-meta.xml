    <textOnly>Dear valued customer, 

Because you are an active MSP Engines customer, Honeywell is offering a promotional pricing discount for the G280 MSP Mechanical Components program through the end of 2020.  

The discount is 20% for Year 1 of the 
coverage and you will still enjoy the same level of service and benefits from MSP Mechanical Components. 

If you have any questions or would like to see a quote, please reach out to your Honeywell point of contact or respond to this message. 

We look forward to hearing from you soon!
