This letter is to inform you of certain cybersecurity requirements effective November 30, 2020 that require Honeywell suppliers in the US Government supply chain to take necessary steps in ensuring compliance prior to receiving further orders after November 30, 2020.



 












 Background: 

Honeywell thanks you for your previous efforts in ensuring compliance to the information security requirements of DFARS 252.204-7012. In extension to this, beginning November 30, 2020, DoD Contracting Officers will be required to include two new DFARS, 252.204-7019 and 252.204-7020, in all solicitations and contracts, except for Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) items, requiring contractors to have and maintain an assessments score using NIST SP 800-171 DoD Assessment Methodology. These obligations flow through the entire DoD supply chain and 252.204-7020 provides that Contractors may not award any subcontract subject to NIST SP 800-171 per 252.204-7012, unless the subcontractor has completed at least a Basic Assessment within the last three years. 


Action Required:

To enable Honeywell to continue awarding Government subcontracts to you without interruption, the following actions steps are required.


	- Step 1: Complete Assessment: You must have completed at least a Basic Assessment in accordance with NIST SP 800-171 DoD Assessment Methodology &lt;[[https://www.acq.osd.mil/dpap/pdi/cyber/docs/NIST SP 800-171 Assessment Methodology Version 1.2.1 6.24.2020.pdf]]&gt; within the last three years for all applicable covered contractor information systems. A Basic Assessment is a self- assessment. If DCMA has already conducted a Medium or High Assessment for your organization and you have received a score, you have satisfied this step.
	- Step 2: Post Assessment Score: If you completed a Basic Assessment, your summary level score and other information required by 252.204-7020(d), must be submitted into SPRS &lt;[[https://www.sprs.csd.disa.mil/default.htm]]&gt; or by sending an encrypted email to webptsmh@navy.mil &lt;[[mailto:webptsmh@navy.mil]]&gt; for posting to SPRS. If you have a Medium or High Assessment score, ensure your score is posted to SPRS for all CAGE codes covered by your System Security Plan.
	- Step 3: Tell Honeywell You’re Done with Steps 1 and 2: Please complete the Honeywell Cyber DFARS Questionnaire &lt;[[https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=JuXsln2csEiNr4uTyQpdGLVhGeRHOrxBqz61IZq6O5RUOFoxVUJXSlVIUExCWEFSNkQ2UEFVNTlJNi4u]]&gt; as soon as possible, but no later than November 17th.



If you have not completed steps 1 and 2 and are subject to these requirements, you should take the necessary steps for compliance as soon as possible to avoid order delays effective November 30, 2020. Also, please ensure that you are taking similar steps to inform your sub-tier suppliers about these new requirements in order to ensure there are no supply chain disruptions.

 Thank you in advance for your cooperation regarding this matter. Please do not hesitate to reach out to your Commodity Manager with SupplierResponsibility@Honeywell.com &lt;[[mailto:SupplierResponsibility@Honeywell.com]]&gt; on copy with any questions or concerns.



Sincerely,
