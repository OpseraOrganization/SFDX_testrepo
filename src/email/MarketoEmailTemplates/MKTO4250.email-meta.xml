    <subject>URGENT, PLEASE READ â€“ Honeywell 2020 Operators Conferences</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Customer}}, 

 To protect the health and safety of our employees and customers, Honeywell is postponing our Operators Conferences globally through May 31, 2020. We made this decision out of an abundance of caution based on the growing number of confirmed COVID-19 coronavirus cases. 

 Please cancel any travel plans as it relates to this event immediately. We plan to reschedule this event for later in the year but as of now, cannot commit to a specific date or location. 

 We realize this is a burden to our customers, but again our decision is based on prioritizing the health of everyone involved. 

 Please contact your Honeywell Customer Service Manager with any questions. 

 Thanks, 

 Honeywell Customer and Product Support</textOnly>
