We are excited to share GoDirect™ Flight Bag Pro &lt;[[https://aerospace.honeywell.com/en/services/aerospace-services/godirect%E2%84%A2-flight-bag-pro]]&gt; now supports both the Bad Elf GPS Pro &lt;[[https://bad-elf.com/products/be-gps-2200]]&gt; and Bad Elf GPS Pro+ &lt;[[https://bad-elf.com/pages/be-gps-2300-detail]]&gt; Bluetooth GPS devices.

Pairing one of these devices with your iPad will provide more accurate GPS position data when activating and flying a route while in 
GoFly mode. This also means you can record a more accurate track log to a trip kit for review after your flight.

Look for more new features and updates in 2019!

Thank you,

The Honeywell GoDirect Team
