    <subject>We want your feedback | 2020 AIN Product Support Survey</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Valued Customer}}, 

We hope this finds you safe and doing as best we all can during this COVID-19 challenge. 

Every year, Aviation International News (AIN) conducts a Product Support Survey where they ask their readers to evaluate aircraft, engines and avionics products for the prior twelve months. The 2020 survey will be released on May 4. 

As a longtime customer of our products and services, we would like to invite you to subscribe to AIN and receive the 2020 survey by following the quick 2 minute registration process using this link: www.ainonline.com/pss/honeywell &lt;[[https://www.ainonline.com/pss/honeywell]]&gt;. If you’re already subscribed to AIN and take the annual survey, then I simply encourage you to watch for and complete the 2020 survey. 

As an engines and avionics manufacturer, Honeywell takes this and other industry surveys seriously. The anonymous results are reviewed by our global leadership and we used the customer feedback from the 2019 survey to improve our products, services and support. Our goal is to achieve top marks in the surveys and we need your feedback to make this happen. Here is a highlight of the changes we made this past year as a result of the survey feedback: 



	- Our virtual network of Field Service Engineers, boasting an average of 30 years’ experience, had 55,000 technical support interactions.
	- Hosted more than 75 in-person customer events across 23 countries to discuss the latest industry trends and mandates.
	- Published more than 3,000 self-help knowledge articles written by our Field Service Engineers, but have more than 10,000 in total.
	- Redesigned Honeywell Aerospace website to streamline the self-help resources and technical support experience for ease of use and access.
