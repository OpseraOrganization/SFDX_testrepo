If you still believe that “take-off” means “turn-off” then it’s time to think again. Passengers are now demanding to stay connected whenever and wherever they are. Fortunately, the age of global, reliable, high-speed airborne connectivity is upon us – and it’s now available for your BBJ aircraft through Comlux Completion. 


JetWave™ is the hardware solution facilitating connection to Inmarsat’s Jet ConneX service, delivering an in-the-air broadband experience comparable to on-the-ground connections. By selecting JetWave, you’ll be enabling your passengers with ‘office equivalent’ productivity and ‘home-equivalent’ connectivity.  For the ultimate entertainment and connectivity experience, pair your JetWave system with Honeywell&apos;s Ovation Select cabin management system.
