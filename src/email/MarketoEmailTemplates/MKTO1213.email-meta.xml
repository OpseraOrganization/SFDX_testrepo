    <subject>Honeywell Survey Assessment Launches This Week</subject>
    <textOnly>&lt;[[https://www.honeywellaidc.com/pages/SiteLanguages.aspx]]&gt;
FEEDBACK WELCOME:  SURVEY LAUNCHES THIS WEEK
Dear Valued Customer,
One of Honeywell’s top priorities is to improve our customer experience.  Your candid feedback in our semi-annual survey – along with feedback you provide through OEM and industry surveys -- is crucial in guiding our improvement efforts so we focus on improving what’s most important to you. 

We have hired an independent research company, Corporate Executive Board, to conduct an online assessment. While this information is completely for Honeywell, the email will come directly from CEB Customer Surveys (CEBCustomerSurveys@executiveboard.com), so please look for the assessment to arrive via email this week.

Your open feedback through this assessment will help us learn more about your recent customer service experiences and what is most important to you.  We appreciate your timely participation, which will remain open for two weeks.

Based on the feedback we have received from past surveys, we’ve taken actions to:
Improve your digital experience with new features and updates to our MyAerospace Portal
Provide 24/7 global and responsive support, technical personnel visits and reliable technical expertise for Honeywell products when and where you need it
Offer no hassle, real-time troubleshooting and solutions through tools such as Honeywell’s Aerospace Remote Connect (ARC)
Enhance communications, create consistent tools, and simplify policies to reduce customer effort so it’s easier to do business with Honeywell
Reduce past dues, improve on-time deliveries, offer more exchanges when timely repair turnaround is at risk and improve our warranty process for more detailed and timely adjudication

The findings from this survey will only be used to make changes to improve your experience with Honeywell and participant identities will be kept confidential. No one will attempt to sell you anything as a result of participating. Beyond our surveys like this one, if you ever have feedback for our team, please contact us at AERO@Honeywell.com.  We would like to hear about your experience with us.

Sincerely,
Heath Patrick 
Vice President, Customer &amp; Product Support 
Honeywell Aerospace
