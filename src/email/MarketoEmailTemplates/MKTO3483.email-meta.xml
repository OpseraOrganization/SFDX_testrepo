    <textOnly>&lt;[[https://aerospace.honeywell.com/]]&gt;

Hello {{lead.First Name:default=edit me}},


As a global leader of high-performance non-ITAR inertial measurement units and navigators, we’re proud to showcase the work that is being done by our customers around the world. 

Aeroscout, a UAV manufacturer and service provider in Switzerland, recently chose our HGuide n580 INS/GNSS navigator &lt;[[https://aerospace.honeywell.com/en/products/navigation-and-sensors/hguide-n580]]&gt; for its industrial unmanned helicopters equipped with LiDAR equipment to capture aerial 
point clouds to conduct powerline inspections, 3D mapping and surveillance worldwide.

You can learn more about Aeroscout and how they’re using our HGuide n580 in combination with LiDAR by watching this video &lt;[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtD50Cd7ilY]]&gt;. 

We’re 
here to help you find the right IMU or navigator for your 3D mapping application. 

For a limited time, you can try a Honeywell IMU or navigator before you buy*. Contact us today to learn more.
