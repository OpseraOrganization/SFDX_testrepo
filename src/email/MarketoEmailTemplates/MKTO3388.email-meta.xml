Dear Operator,


Do you remember the day when you purchased your plane? It sported the state-of-the-art Honeywell Primus 1000 / 2000 cockpit and a lot of other cool technology. Fast forward to the present. You still have a serviceable aircraft, but it’s no longer quite so state-of-the-art or prepared to handle the future state of aviation. What do you do?

You have options:

1. Fly as-is, but that’s not really an option. 
2. Buy a new aircraft with current cockpit technology, but loose a substantial amount of equity. 
3. Or save a substantial amount of money by upgrading it with the most current technology, and increasing equity – the best option. After all, you don’t replace your car when all it needs is a tune-up.

 Join our webinar &quot;Primus 1000/2000 Cockpit Upgrade Options&quot; on Thursday, April 18, at 8:00 a.m. PT / 11:00 a.m. ET.  

You&apos;ll learn how Honeywell can “tune up” your aircraft affordably with Primus Elite Upgrade program options that fit both your budget and operational requirements, while driving down cost of operations. The webinar will be conducted by Honeywell Business Aviation technical experts and will include a Q&amp;A session.
