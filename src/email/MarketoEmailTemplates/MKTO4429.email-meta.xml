    <subject>Your Opinion Matters | 2020 AIN Product Support Survey</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Valued Customer}}, 

We hope this finds you safe and doing as best we can during this COVID-19 challenge. 

 The 2020 Aviation International News (AIN) Product Support Survey is now open. The annual survey asks readers to evaluate aircraft, engines and avionics products they have had experience with during the prior 12 months. 

 At Honeywell, we view the AIN Survey as an important benchmark for improving our products and services. Your participation &lt;[[https://www.ainonline.com/product-support-survey]]&gt; before June 12, 2020 will be highly appreciated. The results and feedback gained through the survey will help us monitor our strengths and successes and, more importantly, identify areas for continued improvement and investment. 

When You Fly, We Fly &lt;[[https://aerospace.honeywell.com/en/pages/when-you-fly-we-fly]]&gt;

 When completing the 2020 AIN Survey, please consider some of steps we’ve taken, based on your feedback to make it easier to work with Honeywell in the last 12 months.
