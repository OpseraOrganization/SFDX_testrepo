Dear Customer,
Avionics are a big investment. If your fleet has Honeywell avionics on board, our Honeywell Avionic Protection Plan (HAPP) can help you save money. By selecting HAPP, our fixed annual cost and flexible payment terms make your budgeting easier – and give you back control of your maintenance budget. The average cost of minor repairs on avionics can be $50,000 and major repairs and exchange $60,000 and higher! With HAPP, the average annual expense is $40,000* so why wouldn&apos;t you jump on board?
*HAPP annual cost does vary per airframe and flight hours the above are based on AW139.
