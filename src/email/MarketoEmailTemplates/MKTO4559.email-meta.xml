    <textOnly>Hello {{lead.First Name:default=there}},

While your aircraft is experiencing downtime, now could be the perfect opportunity to make some of those much-needed or even much-wanted upgrades.


We want to help you take control of more of your flight experience to keep your employees safe and on time. Honeywell’s Primus Elite Advanced Features put more control in pilots’ hands by giving them all the information they need with clear 3D imagery and enhanced graphical features.


The result is faster response times and a reduced workload for pilots because they receive and clearly see information precisely when they need to see it. All this helps pilots create the best and most efficient flight experience possible.


Controlling your flight experience means seeing what can be done to manage the opportunities you have to be more comfortable, productive, safe and cost-efficient. Our flight experience assessments will look at gains you can make with your connectivity, situational awareness and navigation systems.
