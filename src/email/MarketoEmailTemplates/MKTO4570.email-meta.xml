    <subject>Check out our new on-demand dealer’s webinars page</subject>
    <textOnly>Honeywell Aerospace&apos;s live webinars give our dealers a chance to take part in a virtual learning experience. 

By joining our training sessions, you can watch interactive presentations, taught by subject matter experts who are leaders in their respective industries, covering a broad spectrum of topics.

But what if you missed it?

Thinking about our dealers’ tight schedules, Honeywell implemented this new on-demand training and webinars tool, that can be accessed here:

https://aerospace.honeywell.com/en/learn/about-us/partner-resources/cp-webinars-trainings &lt;[[https://aerospace.honeywell.com/en/learn/about-us/partner-resources/cp-webinars-trainings]]&gt;

The new on demand webinars page provides an engaging and learning-rich environment that can be accessed anytime and anywhere through the Internet.

It’s easy-to-use and is customized to meet each of our dealers’ learning &amp; development needs.

We’re excited to launch this new training &amp; development initiative and we’re here to support you every step of the way!

Honeywell’s on demand webinars page is raising the bar for your professional development and growth!

 
Sincerely,
