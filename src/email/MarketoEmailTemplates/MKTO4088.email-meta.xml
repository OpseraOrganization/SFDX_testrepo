When the unexpected happens, count on the Honeywell Maintenance Service Plan to ensure that your aircraft is flight-ready. Honeywell&apos;s signature Maintenance Service Plan is like an extended warranty available on a home, car or major appliance. Business aircraft operators simply choose the coverage that best meets their needs, pay an annual usage-based fee, and stop worrying about the devastating impact of an unplanned equipment failure on their operations and maintenance budget. 


More than 3,800 aircraft are currently covered by Honeywell Maintenance Service Plans globally, providing owners and operators with quality, experience, and peace of mind. 

Control your costs and keep your aircraft flying. Contact Mid Canada Mod Center to learn more about Honeywell MSP or request a custom quote.
