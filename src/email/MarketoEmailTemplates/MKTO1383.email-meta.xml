AEROSPACE IN EUROPE
Quarterly News Briefing
December 2016


 



























 











WELCOME


 


Welcome to the first Honeywell Aerospace in Europe Quarterly News Briefing. I value our meetings this past year and in response to our discussions I am instituting this quarterly communication to continue our connection. Each issue will briefly highlight the latest Honeywell Aerospace activities in Europe, as well as our technology advancements, spanning the commercial, defense and space industries. From our active work in the Single European Sky initiative, to our everyday focus on developing technology that delivers safer, faster, more efficient and comfortable experiences, we are invested in and aligned with the future of aerospace in Europe. I look forward to our next meeting, but until then I hope you enjoy the reading. If you don’t want to receive these messages in the future, please reply to me here &lt;[[mailto:james.bryson@honeywell.com; jake.saylor@honeywell.com]]&gt;.
