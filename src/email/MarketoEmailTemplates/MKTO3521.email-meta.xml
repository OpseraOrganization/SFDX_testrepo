    <subject>Your Repair and Overhaul Quote Form is Changing</subject>
    <textOnly>&lt;[[https://aerospace.honeywell.com/]]&gt;
Dear Customer: 


Reviewing and approving repair and overhaul (R&amp;O) quotes from Honeywell just got easier. Using input from many customers, we are making enhancements to our quote form and process that will simplify and clarify your R&amp;O experience. Our goal is to make it easier do business with us. 


These enhancements include:  


	- Standardized format that allows you to find information easily
	- Direct links to your order for approval
	- Streamlined communication to the Honeywell quotes team for support 
	- Reference-only quotes clearly marked as “FYI Quote: No Action Required”
	- More details including: reason for re-quote, workscope deviation, CID/FOD/abuse identified, recurrent/low-time-failure, and applicable warranty period where applicable
	- Quote alignment to the Honeywell entity that provides your invoice


These updates and more will be released this month. Additional enhancements to service bulletins, exchanges and overhaul repair instructions, and more are in development for early 2019. 
 
For questions or feedback, please contact us &lt;[[https://myaerospace.honeywell.com/contact-us/forms/website-issues/website-feedback]]&gt;.





Sincerely,


Honeywell Aerospace
