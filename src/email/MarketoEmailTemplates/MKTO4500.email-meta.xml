    <textOnly>Hello {{lead.First Name:default=Friend}},

By way of introduction, my name is Bill Kircos and I manage customer marketing here at Honeywell Aerospace. I hope this email finds you, your family and your fellow employees safe and well.

During the highly unusual times weâ€™re all experiencing, I wanted to reach out personally to say thank you for being such an important part of our business. Though the future will see changes in all of our business and personal lives, we will move forward, and Honeywell remains committed to meeting your needs in the short and long term. As part of this commitment, we are working on new marketing initiatives designed specifically with you and your company in mind. Expect to hear more from us on this topic in the coming days. 

Again, we sincerely thank you for your business. Stay safe, stay healthy and know that we stand ready to provide you with options for smarter and more comfortable flying when the time is right.
With warm regards,

 Bill Kircos
