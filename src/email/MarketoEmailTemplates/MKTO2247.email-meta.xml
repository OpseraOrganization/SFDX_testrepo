    <subject>Tech Tips - Boeing 737NG Pneumatic System Troubleshooting</subject>
    <textOnly>&lt;[[https://aerospace.honeywell.com/]]&gt;

Dear Customer, 
Have you experienced a bleed trip light illumination on your 737NG pneumatic system? Boeing has released a helpful video and supporting documentation. 
 
Bleed trip light illumination can be caused by over-pressure or over-temperature conditions. An over-temperature condition is more common than an over-pressure condition. It can be difficult to tell which part might be causing the problem when so many parts can impact pressure or temperature conditions.
 
The pressure regulator shut-off valve (3214552-6) is often replaced when a bleed trip light is activated on the P5 panel. To help identify the correct failed component, Boeing has published a 737NG pneumatic system troubleshooting video.
 
Please refer to the MyBoeingFleet website &lt;https://www.myboeingfleet.com/ReverseProxy/Authentication.html&gt; for the latest aircraft maintenance manual and FIM for the 737NG aircraft. The &quot;737NG Pneumatic System Troubleshooting Training Video&quot; can be found under “Supplemental Videos”.
