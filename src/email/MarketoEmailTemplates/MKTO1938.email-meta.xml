    <subject>Update on Honeywell Aerospace&apos;s Houston, TX Facility</subject>
    <textOnly>&lt;[[https://aerospace.honeywell.com/]]&gt;

Dear Honeywell Customer, 


The Texas Gulf Coast continues to clean up from the battering that Hurricane Harvey gave it over the past week. While the situation seems to be improving in Houston and the surrounding areas, the safety of our employees remains our top priority. So, we are gradually resuming work in our Houston repair &amp; overhaul facility. We have been able to resume some operations yesterday, August 31, and expect to continue to increase operational capacity over the coming days. We have discontinued re-routing work to alternative facilities.
 
We can assure anyone with assets at the facility that your parts have remained safe – and dry. And, we appreciate your thoughts regarding the safety and well-being of our employees.  
 
If you have any questions, please contact your Honeywell account leader. If you do not know who that is, please visit the MyAerospace contact us page &lt;[[http://goaero.honeywell.com/DQkh00U0XI20090kqZ2A0GC]]&gt;
 
Thank you for your business,
Honeywell Aerospace Customer &amp; Product Support
