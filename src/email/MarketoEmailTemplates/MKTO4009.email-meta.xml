Clear up your view of the sky with the latest LCD technology when you upgrade to Primus 
Elite DU-875 displays with Flightstar.

Primus Elite is more than a display upgrade - it’s a new avionics system. While initially designed to overcome upcoming CRT DU-870 obsolescence, DU-875 delivers:


	- 
Enhanced flight management tools

	- Improved safety and reliability
	- Less maintenance
	- Reduced cost of ownership
	- A 12-month warranty
	- Does not require additional pilot training or modifications to the cockpit
	- Downtime for the upgrade in most cases is only ten working days


For a limited time, when you upgrade all four display units on your Lear 40/45 and install Primus Elite today, you’ll be eligible to take advantage of Honeywell trade-in credits 
of up to $140,000 plus receive one free year of MSP Avionics coverage.

Prefer a phased approach? You’ll still receive a $35,000 Honeywell trade-in credit for each DU-870 display you replace, as well as a $2,500 discount per display on a new or extended MSP 
contract.
These offers expire on December 31, 2019, so don’t delay.
