    <textOnly>Dear Customer, Benefit from a comprehensive coverage of your Honeywell and Universal Avionics components under one maintenance program with Maintenance Service Plan (MSP) – Avionics. Our third-party agreement with Universal enables us to extend our maintenance offering and service range with one main goal – to help you protect your aircraft.  There are multiple platforms eligible for this coverage including Dassault, Gulfstream, Cessna, and Bombardier models. If your aircraft has EFI-890, FMS, MFD-640, Unilink, TAWS, or other Universal Avionics components, we encourage you to reach out to us to learn more about our new MSP third-party program. We greatly value the opportunity to tell you more about the benefits of this program. Send us an email &lt;[[mailto:MSPAvionicsSales@Honeywell.com?subject=Learn%20more%20about%20Third%20Party%20Universal%20Program]]&gt; and we will provide you with additional information that is tailored to the equipment onboard your aircraft.
