Dear Customer,



The world is changing. Now, more than ever, it is imperative that fleets are equipped with the latest generation equipment that increases operational efficiency and safety. This is where Honeywell can help.

Honeywell has taken an industry lead in developing advanced inertial navigation systems and communication radios to make flights safer and more efficient. 

Find out more about the upgrades that let pilots know precisely the attitude &amp; position of the aircraft, and enable communication with radio systems:



	- Enhanced Ground Proximity Warning System (EGPWS) &lt;[[https://pages3.honeywell.com/Email_RMU_EGPWS.html]]&gt; predicts and warns flight crews of potential conflicts with obstacles or terrain

	- Datalink Services &lt;[[https://pages3.honeywell.com/Email_RMU_Datalink.html]]&gt; enhance the accuracy and relevance of ATC messaging to pilots in compliance with the CPDLC mandate

	- Integrated Multi-Mode Receiver (IMMR) &lt;[[https://pages3.honeywell.com/Email_RMU_IMMR.html]]&gt;, industry’s only fully digital navigation receiver 

	- IntuVue 3-D Weather Radar System &lt;[[https://pages3.honeywell.com/Email_RMU_INTUVUE.html]]&gt; provides the most complete, accurate and intuitive view of airborne weather hazards





Listed above are a few of the upgrade and retrofit options. Contact us today &lt;[[https://aerospace.honeywell.com/en/terrain-awareness-and-navigation-assistance#standards-challenge]]&gt; to learn more about our suite of navigation, communication and data management solutions.
