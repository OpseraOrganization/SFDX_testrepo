Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Customer}},


“Companies using business aviation routinely out-perform similar companies that do not use business aviation.” – NBAA.org

One thing these best performing companies have in common is that an overwhelming majority leverage the flexibility of business jets to save time, boost collaboration and enable an office-in-the-sky. 

The silent hero onboard their business jets to keep information flowing and productivity high is the Wi-Fi connectivity system. Making sure your business jet is equipped with fast and reliable internet is your secret competitive advantage. 

Maintain your passengers’ competitive edge by upgrading your business jet with Honeywell’s JetWave™ system &lt;[[https://aerospace.honeywell.com/wifithatflies#business-jets]]&gt;, which exclusively powers Jet ConneX – a global, fast, consistent Wi-Fi experience.
