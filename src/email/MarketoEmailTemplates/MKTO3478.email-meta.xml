&quot;Helping you stay on time and on target during critical shutdowns&quot;


We recognize that unscheduled shutdowns cost plants an average of $2.5M per day in losses.  

Honeywell’s drone inspection services &lt;[[https://aerospace.honeywell.com/uav]]&gt; allows you to inspect your equipment safely without shutting down your facility, unlike traditional crews and cranes. And unlike cranes and crews which can put workers in harm’s way – our drone inspections keep boots on the ground while still providing better imagery, insights and details. 

What’s more, our drone service includes an onsite engineer or field technician from Honeywell’s UOP Callidus® engineering team who provides immediate feedback as well as a detailed report to identify heat damage, compromised structural components, failing ignition systems and more. 

 For more information or to speak to one of our regional technical managers, please contact us below.
