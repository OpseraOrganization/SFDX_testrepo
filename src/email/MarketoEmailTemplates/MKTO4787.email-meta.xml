    <textOnly>Hi {{lead.First Name:default=there}},

Would it help you to have an HGuide engineer or sales manager give you a product demo? 

 Weâ€™re committed to helping our customers find the right product for their applications. 

 Please let us know if we can setup a product demo by contacting your HGuide sales manager. 

 We look forward to working with you. 

Best,

The HGuide Support Team</textOnly>
