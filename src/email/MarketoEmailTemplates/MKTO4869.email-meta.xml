	- Launch Connected Maintenance
	- User name: use your existing user name
	- Password: use your existing password


Please make sure you bookmark the new application URL and share it with colleagues who are using PTMD. If you experience any problems, our support team is available for your questions.

Note: there is no additional cost associated with the transition to Honeywell Forge.
