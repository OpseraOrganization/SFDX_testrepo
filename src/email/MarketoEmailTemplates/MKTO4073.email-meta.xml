Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Customer}},

With everyone on board checking emails, downloading movies and FaceTiming, data usage gets hard to control. Luckily, Honeywell offers GoDirect™ Services to put you in control of your inflight connectivity. 
 
 GoDirect Data Control gives you the power to allocate how data is used on the aircraft, allowing you to restrict consumption of other guests and control how much data is used by 
video-streaming and other heavy-bandwidth applications.  Additionally, with GoDirect Filter you can ensure all the data sent and received from your aircraft cabin is used productively, not for items such as background 
updates.
 
 Take control of your inflight data by contacting Pentastar Aviation to learn more about Honeywell&apos;s GoDirect Services and their JetWave SATCOM solution to support all your connectivity needs.
