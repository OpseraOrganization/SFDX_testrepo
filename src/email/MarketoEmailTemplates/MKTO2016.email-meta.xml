Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Customer}},


A couple weeks ago, we contacted you to understand your plans to upgrade to FMS 6.1. We’d like to learn more about how we can help. After all, customers who do not upgrade before Dec. 31 will be charged an additional 20% surcharge to their annual navigational database subscription.

Please take this short, one-question survey to help us understand how we can assist.






COMPLETE THE SURVEY  &lt;[[https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/RG7665H]]&gt;






Sincerely,

The Honeywell Aerospace Team</textOnly>
