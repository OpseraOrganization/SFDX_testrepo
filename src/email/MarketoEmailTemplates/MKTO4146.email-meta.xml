    <textOnly>Master Production Schedule Update
Dear Valued Supplier, 

 Honeywell sincerely thanks our many suppliers for meeting commitments by providing quality parts on-time. In some cases, however, we continue to experience quality and delivery performance issues across our extended supply base, resulting in material availability gaps for Honeywell and our customers. 

 To further improve delivery over the next few weeks, Honeywell will be adjusting the Master Production Schedule (MPS). This MPS reconciliation better aligns our entire supply base capacity and materials, allowing us to send clear priorities to our suppliers and internal sites and ultimately improves the flow of parts. 

 We recognize these changes can pose challenges. This is an ongoing process, and we will continue to update our production plans based on the material plans we receive from our suppliers to meet the expectations of our customers. 

 If specific order modifications are necessary, you are expected to promptly acknowledge and accept these Purchase Order changes. Please work with your respective Honeywell Procurement contact with any concerns or questions related to this activity. It’s important that all supplier commitment dates are current and accurate. 

 Thank you for your support in helping optimize delivery for our joint-end customers. We can’t deliver our products without you. 

 Bob Buddecke
