    <subject>MyGDC Mobile App to be discontinued. Simple Transition to GoDirect Flight Bag Pro to Keep Planning</subject>
    <textOnly>&lt;[[https://aerospace.honeywell.com/]]&gt;
Hello,

If you haven’t already done so, now is the time to install the updated version of the GoDirect™ Flight Bag Pro application. In the next 90 days, support for the MyGDC mobile app will be discontinued and you’ll need to download and install the updated version of GoDirect Flight Bag Pro to continue filing flight plans. 

Our new web and app experience features a fresh new look and features that makes creating, computing and filing flight plans faster, easier and more accurate than ever before. Learn more &lt;[[https://aerospace.honeywell.com/en/services/aerospace-services/godirect%E2%84%A2-flight-bag-pro]]&gt;. We are thrilled to bring you this new experience!

Visit your app store today or to the download page to get the updated version of the app. If you have questions about the new app or would like hands on training, call us at (888) 634-3330 or email us at flightservices@honeywell.com &lt;[[mailto:flightservices@honeywell.com]]&gt;. We are here to support you. 

Thank you for being a GoDirect Flight Services customer. We hope you enjoy the enhanced convenience and control the new application provides. 

Thank you! 

The GoDirect Flight Services Team</textOnly>
