Honeywell’s HTS900 engine powers the Eagle Copters’ 407HP upgrade to the Bell 407. With more than 5,000 operational flight hours, the 407HP upgrade enables operators to:


	- Fly further with 17% lower fuel burn than the existing engine
	- Increase their payload by 500lbs more than the stock aircraft
	- Reduce operating costs by enabling a 12% reduction in direct maintenance for the engine as a result of its on-condition maintenance approach and rotating component service life of 15,000 hours/cycles


As the 407HP is seeing higher demand across new areas like firefighting and wildlife management, the HTS900 helps operators carry heavier loads while lowering fuel burn for an extended time on patrol.
