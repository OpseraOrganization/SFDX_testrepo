    <textOnly>Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Customer}}, 



GoDirect Flight Preview &lt;[[https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/godirect-flight-preview/id1069477207]]&gt; is an app that allows you to virtually fly any approach into any airport in the USA. In addition to seeing the static approach plate, Flight Preview allows you to view a 3D rendering of the flight path after you select the runway, approach type, initial approach fix, and an option to view the suggested missed approach path.



We are surveying current and potential users to improve the product.



We would love to hear your feedback. Please spend five minutes and take our short product survey.
