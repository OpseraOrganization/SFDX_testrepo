    <subject>PM-CPDLC - Modernizing Air to Ground Information Exchanges</subject>
    <textOnly>&lt;[[https://aerospace.honeywell.com/]]&gt;

Dear valued customer,

The 2020 Mandate requirement for Protected Mode Controller Pilot Data Link Communication (PM-CPDLC) is set for February 2020. But for a carrier like yours, retrofit decisions are not forced by mandates, rather are driven by your commitment to business efficiency and gaining competitive advantage. Here are 5 reasons to retrofit Honeywell Data Link solutions: 



	- Increase the speed of information dissemination, both to and from the aircraft




	- Improve information delivery speed to help eliminate delays




	- Minimize common communication problems between air traffic controller and pilot 




	- Provide easy update of route clearances into the aircraft’s flight plan




	- Automate routine pilot tasks such as clearances, microphone checks, and ATC handoffs



Honeywell&apos;s Communication Management Unit (CMU) MKII+, VHF Data Link (VDL) Mode 2 Radios, Cockpit Voice Recorder (CVR) and Airplane Information Management System (AIMS) are designed for today’s PM-CPDLC requirements and are on the Eurocontrol White List for approved PM-CPDLC avionics.

Please contact Honeywell at your earliest opportunity to understand how Honeywell can help your airline modernize air to ground information exchanges and comply with the PM-CPDLC mandate.
