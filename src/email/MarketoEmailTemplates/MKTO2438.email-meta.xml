LET FMS 6.1 TAKE YOU TO NEW HEIGHTS
Dear Customer,

The FMZ-2000 has been the Flight Management System of choice for business aviation since it was introduced, more than 20 years ago. Since then, regular updates and new features have ensured that the FMZ-2000 has kept pace with the times and operators’ needs.


Software Version 6.1 adds new capabilities to operators’ legacy FMZ-2000 systems. These upgrades deliver:



	- Improved flight safety 

	- On-time performance 

	- Reduced fuel consumption  &amp; emissions 

	- Increased airport access
	- Reduced pilot workload 


How does the FMS 6.1 do all that? Some of the key features of the upgrade are:



	- Vectors to final approach

	- Multiple runway approaches

	- Improved leg combinations

	- Circling approaches

	- Enroute holding patterns

	- Updated magnetic variation tables

	- Temperature compensation

	- Auto hold-to-altitude

	- Required nav performance monitoring and alerting





Operators should also be aware that from 2018, Navigation Database pricing for legacy systems will be subject to a 20% surcharge – with additional increases in subsequent years. So act quickly to secure the 2018 deal!
