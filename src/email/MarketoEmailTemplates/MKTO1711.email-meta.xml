    <textOnly>Act Now! Protect Your Learjet 45 before June 30th, 2017 Dear valued customer, 
 

Your avionics are a big investment…an investment worth protecting. Designed specifically for business aviation, the Honeywell Avionics Protection Plan (HAPP) is an extended warranty program that offers full coverage for Honeywell avionics – because the unexpected can happen.  

With your DU870 display units reaching the end of their life there has never been a better time to take out HAPP. Enroll now and the protection HAPP offers means you&apos;ll have access to DU870 exchange support till the end of 2020.  

What&apos;s more enroll in HAPP through ExecuJet South Africa before June 30th 2017 and you’ll receive a 15% discount on the annual enrollment fees. For example, standard HAPP pricing for a Lear 45, flying 300 hours per year, with standard equipment would be US$49,500. Sign up before June 30th and the cost will be US$ 42,075 – a saving of US$7,425!! The discount is applicable on the duration of the HAPP contract – so the longer you commit to HAPP – the more you’ll save! 

So don&apos;t worry, be HAPPy.
