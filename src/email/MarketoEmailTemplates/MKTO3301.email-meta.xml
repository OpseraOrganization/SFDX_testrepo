    <subject>Don’t Wait Another Minute. Schedule Mandate Upgrades Today!</subject>

The deadline for 2020 mandates is fast approaching. But, in most scenarios if your upgrades aren’t scheduled by July, you won’t get in before the deadline.

If your aircraft isn’t compliant with the 2020 FAA mandates, there’s no better time than NOW to upgrade with Honeywell’s solutions. Honeywell’s solutions for the ADS-B Out and FANS 1/A mandates offer owners a low risk, high value option for mandate compliance.  

Why install Honeywell’s Upgrades?



	- Minimal impact to your aircraft during the upgrade, unlike the low-cost aftermarket solutions which require external systems and are not guaranteed to be compatible with future evolutions of the airspace requirements.
	- High reliability of Honeywell products.

	- Your Aircraft Bluebook value will increase in value with an integrated system.

	- Take advantage of a 100% tax write-off for component upgrades. 


Spirit Aeronautics &lt;[[http://www.spiritaeronautics.com]]&gt; still has capacity for ADS-B upgrades, as well as the required STCs for Cessna 550, 560, 560XL, 560 XLS, Hawker 800 XP, Challenger 601 and Falcon 900 aircraft.  Click below to contact Spirit Aeronautics to request a quote or to learn more about Honeywell’s integrated solutions.
