We’ve got 60-seconds &lt;[[https://corpapp.honeywell.com/sites/honvideo/Pages/Player.aspx?bctid=4847727054001&amp;UsrId=e045068&amp;ItmId=5919]]&gt; to talk about how good communication starts with GOOD WRITING. 

We’ve been writing all our lives, so it seems simple. But most of the business letters that get written are really pretty bad.
Here’s why: Far too often we write to impress people. We make it formal, we use BIG words, and we complicate thoughts to make us look smart.
But the only thing we convince them of is that we’re bad communicators.









 

The key is to keep it short, lean and easy to read. 


 








Over the next six sessions we’ll pass along some simple, proven ways to accomplish that, and to create experiences that prove to the customer just how good you really are.
