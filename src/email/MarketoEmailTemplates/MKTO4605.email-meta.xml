    <textOnly>Hello {{lead.First Name:default=there}},
 
If youâ€™re thinking about using this downtime to upgrade elements of your company&apos;s flight experience, we invite you to take a look at how we have improved the flight experience for country superstar George Strait.

You can use his thoughts to learn about systems that will make life more productive for passengers, as well as keep information secure and connectivity reliable.

Learn more about why George relies on Honeywell systems in his aircraft to travel from his Texas home to concert sites, personal appearances and charity events across the country.
