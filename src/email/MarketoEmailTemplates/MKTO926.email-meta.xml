Avoid customs delays in Canada by adding d.b.a. PEI to your shipping documents. 
 

To help understand and comply with regulations governing the Honeywell Canada Prince Edward Island (PEI) site, we’ve pulled together everything you need to know in one easy-to-follow guidebook &lt;[[https://pages3.honeywell.com/rs/641-QIX-912/images/HON Canada Customer-Vendor Shipping Instructions - PEI.pdf]]&gt;.









 

Here are few things you’ll want to pay particular attention to as you read through the guide &lt;[[https://pages3.honeywell.com/rs/641-QIX-912/images/HON Canada Customer-Vendor Shipping Instructions - PEI.pdf]]&gt;:





 - Customs requires that you add a note, or “d.b.a PEI” to your shipping invoice. The guide &lt;[[https://pages3.honeywell.com/rs/641-QIX-912/images/HON Canada Customer-Vendor Shipping Instructions - PEI.pdf]]&gt; explains exactly what information needs to be included in your note.



 - If the information is missing, your shipment may be delayed in customs.


 - International shipments imported into Honeywell Canada PEI must be in compliance with Canada Border Services Agency invoice requirements. Shipments that aren’t in compliance may be held up at the border, or returned.
