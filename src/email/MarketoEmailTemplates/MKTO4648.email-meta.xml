    <subject>Special offers for {{lead.ABM Company Name:default=you}}</subject>
    <textOnly>Hello once again {{lead.First Name:default=Friend}},

We’ve recently communicated with you about making the most of your aircraft’s downtime. We have enjoyed sharing with you how now could be an opportune time to make upgrades and how our products can help make the most of time spent in the air. We hope you’ve enjoyed hearing how champion NASCAR driver Brad Keselowski and country music superstar George Strait have benefited as well. 

In many cases, with new and updated Honeywell equipment, your benefits will be higher but your overall costs may be lower. Your productivity may increase, and comfort and entertainment on board will make flying a pleasure. And up in the flight deck, pilots will have the information they need to make safer, smarter decisions and create better flight experiences for everyone. 

Yet even with all these advantages, we know that the decision might still come down to matters of pricing. After all, it’s up to you to safeguard company funds and make the best choices.

With that in mind, we would like to invite you to see the special offers we’ve curated especially for you.
