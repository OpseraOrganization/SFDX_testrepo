Dear Valued Customer,




Honeywell’s TFE731 certified engine exchange program gives you the option to get another couple trips or even a couple more years out of your aircraft.


Our inventory is made up of several different options to give you the flexibility and price points that fit your budget.

You don’t need to set up an account to get started, making buying an engine easier and faster than ever before.

Exchange your current engine with Honeywell today and receive a minimum core value for your trade-in. When you do, you’ll receive up to a one year warranty on the purchased engine and we’ll pay for shipping both ways.

Browse our certified, pre-owned TFE731 inventory and choose the engine that’s right for you today. Inventory is limited!
