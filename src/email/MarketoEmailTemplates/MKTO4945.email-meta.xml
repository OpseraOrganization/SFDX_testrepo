    <textOnly>Dear Supplier, 

 Honeywell is making minor updates to the Preferred Carrier Guide, maximizing the opportunity for mutual cost savings while facilitating business needs and driving customer satisfaction. 

 WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW 

 Please note the following regarding Small Pack shipments and, if needed, adjust your shipping practices accordingly. 



	- Effective immediately, FedEx is our Preferred Small Pack Carrier for all U.S. and Canada shipments.
	- Small Parcel, or Small Pack, is defined as packages weighing less than 150 lbs. and/or measuring less than 30” in any direction.
	- DHL WW Express remains our Preferred Small Pack Carrier for international shipments.
	- UPS WW Express is preferred for use only in EMEA-EMEA inter-country shipments.
	- Suppliers using xCarrier: 


	- The SAP Routing Table will be updated effective January 31, and changes will be reflected next time you enter the portal after this date.


	- Suppliers not using xCarrier:


	- Please refer to the routing guide below for all small parcel shipments, confirming compliance within your company’s standard processes.
- Should you have an issue with our Preferred Carriers or need to validate a billing account for a carrier change, please contact your dedicated Buyer or Commodity Manager. 	- Please note that your Honeywell point of contact must seek approval through internal Honeywell processes to authorize shipping via overnight or priority services. 	- Understand that this is a high-level routing guide and exceptions will occur related to regional limitations and requirements; please contact your dedicated Buyer or Commodity Manager should you wish to discuss alternative options to the system default. 

 Thank you for your continued commitment to understanding these important process changes while meeting our customer’s expectations by providing industry-leading products and services.</textOnly>
