    <subject>Honeywell Transitioning Work From Our Tulsa Facility By December 2021</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear Customer,

 Honeywell continually reviews our business to ensure we’re serving customers effectively. After a thorough evaluation, Honeywell Aerospace announced we will close our facility in Tulsa, Oklahoma by December 2021, moving work to other Honeywell sites. 

 We expect this transition to be seamless for you and do not anticipate any disruptions to your orders. We have established a dedicated transition team composed of functional experts and leaders from throughout Honeywell Aerospace to manage the transition process and ensure there is no break in service or shipments during this period. Our commitment to customer service does not wane during a transition.

 Although this change does not impact you immediately, we do anticipate changes or actions that you will need to complete in the coming months. We will certainly keep you updated as those changes or actions become necessary over the next several months. 

In the meantime, if you have any questions, please contact your Honeywell point of contact.  
 
Sincerely, 
 
 Honeywell Aerospace
Customer &amp; Product Support</textOnly>
