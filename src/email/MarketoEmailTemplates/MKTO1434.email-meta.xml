    <textOnly>MYAEROSPACE PORTAL | ORDER STATUS ENHANCEMENTS






To our Valued Customers,

Our goal is to make it easier to do business with Honeywell. The MyAerospace Portal  &lt;[[http://www.myaerospace.honeywell.com]]&gt;is your online resource to access technical support, place orders, and manage services. To give you better visibility and control over your orders, we have enhanced our Order Status application user interface and adding visibility to repair orders. 

These enhancements will reduce your effort and increase order processing speed.









Order Summary

Intuitive graphs group orders by status for each order category to clearly see status for repairs, spares, and exchange orders. 

View by-site summaries with
interactive breakdowns to navigate directly into areas of interest.










Search For Orders

Search by a variety of criteria to easily locate your order.

Filters make even high order quantities navigable.
