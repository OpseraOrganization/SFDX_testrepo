Falcon and Gulfstream business jet owners experience shorter down times in between flights when they upgrade to Honeywell’s wireless data LAN management unit (DLMU-W) with Pro Star Aviation.

Coupled with Honeywell’s MyHDM and MyMaintainer mobile apps, pilots can load critical flight data at the gate, making it easier for them get the information off the plane before it takes off again.

And, with Pro Star’s mobile response “On-the-Fly” option, they can complete the DLMU-W upgrade quickly at your location while you’re in meetings—there’s no need to ground your aircraft for this upgrade.

Improve flight operations and start downloading data more efficiently. Contact us today to speak to an expert at Pro Star Aviation about Honeywell’s DLMU-W upgrade.
