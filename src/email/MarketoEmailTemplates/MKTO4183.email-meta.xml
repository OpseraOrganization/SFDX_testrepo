    <subject>Action: Coronavirus Impact: Help Us With Your Supply Chain Assessment</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear Supplier: 

 Honeywell continues to monitor the 2019-nCoV coronavirus situation both in China and globally. As countries address the spread of the virus, several municipal and provincial governments throughout the country, including Shanghai, are requiring all enterprises to remain closed until at least February 10. 

 We are evaluating the potential effects, as well as working with our suppliers and internal supply base to minimize any potential disruptions while complying with all instructions from national and local authorities.

 It is critical that we gain a comprehensive understanding of whether and how your entire supply chain, including sub-tier suppliers, has been or 
will be impacted by these events. I am asking you to please complete this assessment &lt;[[https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/QLGW3VD]]&gt; within the next 24 hours. 

 Thank you for your partnership to ensure on-time delivery to our mutual end customers. 

 Sincerely, 
 Bob Buddecke
