    <subject>Tech Tips - Easy EGPWS Terrain Database Loading</subject>
    <textOnly>&lt;[[https://aerospace.honeywell.com/]]&gt;

Dear Customer, 
We want to make it easy for you to download and load your Enhanced Ground Proximity Warning System (EGPWS) terrain database. 
 
Whether it’s a new database or you’re upgrading to the latest version, these videos explain the process to make your experience as easy as possible. If you encounter any errors while loading the database, there is an additional video that helps you perform a self-test. This will help determine the cause of the error and resolve the issue quickly.
 
And, as you watch these videos, don’t worry if the MyAerospace screens appear differently now – we’ve recently updated the user experience! The link names and processes remain the same.
