Enable wireless data loading and connect to your Primus Epic® cockpit more efficiently with the Honeywell wireless data LAN management unit (DLMU-W) upgrade by Pro Star Aviation.

The DLMU-W hardware upgrade, coupled with Honeywell’s MyHDM and MyMaintainer mobile apps, allow pilots to load flight data faster and easier than ever using a tablet instead of CDs or USB devices.

Falcon and Gulfstream business jet owners invest in the DLMU-W upgrade because it’s cost-effective, it improves dispatch reliability, it reduces downtime between flights and it doesn’t require significant wiring or equipment changes.

Plus, you don’t have to bring in a maintenance technician to complete the data loading after a flight because the DLMU-W makes it effortless for the pilot to do it from their tablet.

Improve flight operations and start downloading data more efficiently. Contact us today to speak to an expert at Pro Star Aviation about Honeywell’s DLMU-W upgrade.
