Dear Honeywell Customer,


I would like to make you aware of some changes being made to our technical support processes.  In order to deliver consistently faster, more accurate answers to your questions, Honeywell Aerospace is reconfiguring our technical support organization.


Our Technical Operations Center (TOC) staff, Field Service Engineers (FSE), and Product Service Engineers (PSE) will work together as a cohesive unit under the new Aerospace Technical Support (ATS) organization. 
 
Starting 2nd of June 2014, the new Aerospace Technical Support organization will be your direct link to all technical support inquiries. Please save these contact details:


Aerospace Technical Support:  
By Phone:        +1-602-365-6500 
By Email:         AeroTechSupport@Honeywell.com
By Mobile App:  http://honeywellaero.force.com/bgadir &lt;http://honeywellaero.force.com/bgadir&gt;
 
With this reorganization, your existing Field Service Engineers will no longer be your direct access to technical support but access to the entire Honeywell FSE network anytime, anywhere.
 
You will benefit from this new ATS organization by having access to: 



 - 24/7 technical support
 - Virtually co-located network of engineers into a common team to support the various B&amp;GA products families
 - Enhanced “Return to Service” support by making technical experts available via one number
 - Same direct number for technical inquiries and mailbox
 - Consistent technical support experience for all operators and channel partners



 
The ATS and our AOG teams will work hand in hand to resolve AOGs in the most efficient way available to return aircraft into service, whether that be technical support, an accelerated repair, or access to a 
part. 
 
AOG contact details:              
By Phone:       +1-602-365-3099
By Email:         AOG@honeywell.com


As always, we welcome your comments and feedback.
 
Thank You,
Honeywell Aerospace
