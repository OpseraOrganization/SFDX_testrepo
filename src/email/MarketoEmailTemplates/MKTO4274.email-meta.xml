    <subject>Honeywell Connected Enterprise COVID-19: Customer Update</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear Customer: 

We know many of our valued customers and partners such as yourself are assessing the impact and the disruptions caused by the COVID-19 coronavirus. Our thoughts are with your employees and their families at this very difficult time. 

 Like other companies, we are making adjustments to accommodate local mandates and COVID-19 precautions. While some of our employees are working from home, your Honeywell contacts are available and sales representatives are actively working and serving our customers. Business-critical travel is being supported at this time, but we are encouraging our sales and support personnel to engage virtually as much as possible. Please continue to reach out to them as you normally would. 

 Honeywell’s Connected Aerospace Operations &amp; Support teams are committed to providing our customers with continued services and support throughout this unprecedented event. We understand the importance of the services we provide to your operation. We are working diligently to ensure these services continue uninterrupted while taking into account the safety of our employees, their families and our customers worldwide. 

 In cases where we are working at customers’ sites, we are taking steps to ensure that our employees are safe and productive. Our project managers remain the onsite experts to handle situations as they evolve, and any delays or issues will be discussed directly with your team. We appreciate your understanding in this rapidly shifting environment. 

Honeywell activated its global, cross-functional Incident Management Team (IMT), including our Honeywell medical team, several weeks ago. Our IMT meets daily and provides guidance for our businesses and employees in response to the latest COVID-19 news and local/regional directives. All Honeywell sites have plans in place with specific roles and responsibilities relating to this health crisis. 

 The safety of our employees and customers is our top priority and we continue to monitor the COVID-19 situation globally. As circumstances change, we may reach out with more information or an update. In the meantime, please know that we appreciate your continued support of Honeywell and your business. 

 Sincerely,

 Que Dallara
