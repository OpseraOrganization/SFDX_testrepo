A Message to M&amp;PM and E&amp;T Leaders Regarding Intellectual Property Metrics

December 2014

Dear Colleagues:

Honeywell is one of the Top 30 companies in patents granted in the United States each year with Aerospace contributing about 30% of those patents. The continued creativity and submittal of invention ideas is critical for the protection of our product revenue and competitive advantage. As a result, we encourage the prompt submittal of invention ideas that support our products through the Worldwide Invention Disclosure System &lt;http://goaero.honeywell.com/q2XQ0G0RqO0Z6B02I06100v&gt; (WIDS), and are asking for your 
support in sharing this message across your organization.
 
 For the M&amp;PM and E&amp;T leaders on this distribution, we will be providing quarterly metrics in the areas of relevance to your organization. The intent is to inform and solicit your support to drive actions as needed for your area of influence.
 
 The appended metrics (1) Disclosure Submittals and (2) Disclosure Decisions (patent filings) have been prepared year-to-date through September. (December 2014 Quarterly Metrics &lt;https://teamsites2013.honeywell.com/sites/IPTracking/Wiki/2014%20Actuals/2014%20Quarterly%20Metrics/Quarterly%20Metrics_December%202014.pptx&gt;)




(1)  Disclosure Submittals (by IP Steering Committee YTD vs. Historical)

Purpose: Communicate quantity of disclosures received from Aerospace inventors versus 
historical averages
 Details:  Purple line indicates historical average 
(2011-2013). Percentages indicate disclosures received as a % of the historical average. 
 
 Commentary: 



 - Disclosure submittals for Aerospace overall have increased 3% over the historical 
average
 - Electric Power: 55% increase driven by EGTS inventions
 - SIM-CNIS: 50% increase driven by data link, data management, flight data recorder inventions
 - Wheels &amp; Brakes: 50% increase driven by Next Generation Carbon project
 - Other IPSCs above historical averages: Aero Services, Displays, FMS, Navigation
 - IPSCs far below historical averages: Integrated Avionics, Lighting, Strategic Technology



Who has actions: 
 &gt;&gt;&gt; E&amp;T T3 Leaders - Monitor deviations from historical averages. Is this in line with your expectations? Drive actions as needed within your organization



Note:  This metric has been updated to illustrate IPSC’s which are having a significant deviation from historical disclosure averages.   A significant deviation is defined as those IPSC’s  that have disclosure submittals of less than 75% of the historical year-to-date (YTD) average for that IPSC.

 

(2) Disclosures Decisions (to File US patents by IP Steering Committee YTD)  

Purpose: Communicate quantity of disclosures reviewed by each 
IPSC steering committee. Out of those, highlight the quantity and % of decisions to File patents in the US 

Details: Total bar (green + blue) indicates the number of 
disclosures in which a decision was made (file or no file) in each IPSC year to date. Green bar indicates the quantity of those decisions that were “yes” to file
 
 Commentary: 


 - Decisions to file for Aerospace overall increased to 36%  vs. historical average (~32%, 2011-2013)
 - Far exceeding the average filing rate: Electric Power (43%), Navigation (64%), SIM-Surveillance (51%), Wheels &amp; Brakes (61%)
 - Far below the average filing rate: Aero Services (21%), CS-FMS (9%), CS-Integrated Avionics (25%)



Who has actions: 
 &gt;&gt;&gt;  IPSC Leaders - Review the filing rate which is influenced by incoming disclosure quality and/or IPSC review 
standards. Is this filing rate in line with your expectations? Drive actions as needed.
