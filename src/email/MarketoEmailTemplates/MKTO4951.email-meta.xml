    <textOnly>Hello!
 
 My name is {{lead.BK Sales Manger Full Name:default=Vojtech Podhradsky}} and I’m a sales manager at BendixKing. I’m excited that you are considering our products for your aircraft. 

 To help me best serve you, please take a minute to tell me a little more about how I can help:


	- Do you need technical support or a quote?
	- Are there any other BendixKing products you’d like to discuss?
	- How is your aircraft currently outfitted? Example: GPS, Attitude Indicator, Transponder, Autopilot, etc.


Thank you for your time.
