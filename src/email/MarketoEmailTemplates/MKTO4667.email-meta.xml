    <textOnly>Hi {{lead.First Name:default=there}},

One reason why our customers choose Honeywell HGuide products is because they’re reliable, durable and are designed to withstand some of the harshest environments. 

 To prove these claims, we’ve put our products to the test under the most extreme conditions: 



	- Honeywell’s HG4930 survives 80mph hits from a hockey team &lt;[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGWuTsv5rBs&amp;vl=en]]&gt;
	- HGuide n580 is scorched in the Sonoran Desert with a flame thrower &lt;[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Zmt1GuKD8s]]&gt;


We hope you enjoy these videos and more importantly, are looking forward to using a product that will always work when you need it. 

 We look forward to working with you. 

Best,
The HGuide Support Team</textOnly>
