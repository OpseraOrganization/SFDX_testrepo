Hello!

<br /> My name is Tom and I’m the technical sales manager for Honeywell’s microelectronic portfolio. I'm excited that you are considering our products for your next project. 
<br />
<br /> To help us best serve you, please take a minute to tell us a little more about your inquiry: 
<br /> 
<ol> 
<li>What is your role?</li> 
<li>Is your question technical (product selection / data sheet) or transactional (quote / lead time)?</li> 
</ol> Thanks for your time. 
<br />
<br /> Tom
