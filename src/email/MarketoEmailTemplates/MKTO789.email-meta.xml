    <subject>IPSC Performance - January 2016</subject>
    <textOnly>Email Title
July 2015

Dear Colleagues: Appended are the monthly Intellectual Property Steering Committee (IPSC) performance metrics for July 2015. The intent is to track our ability to make timely decisions on invention reviews and assist troubleshooting issues. This effort has taken on additional importance with the US first inventor to file patent system. The appended metrics will provide a rolling three month trend. (July 2015 Metrics &lt;https://teamsites2013.honeywell.com/sites/IPTracking/Wiki/2015%20Actuals/2015%20Monthly%20Metrics/IPSC%20Performance%20Metric_July%202015.pptx&gt;) 

Purpose: Communicate why disclosure decisions are delayed to IPSC stakeholders and highlight where actions need 
to occur to resolve the problem.

Commentary: 


 - Overall: Inventions reviewed 110; performance flat – 37% inventions delayed, several IPSCs in “Red”
 - High Attendance Delays (P, M) -15 total
 - High Delinquencies (D) – Engines-15, Thermal Systems (ECS)-4
 - Engines IPSC – 5 month trend below 50% inventions reviewed



Who has actions: 

&gt;&gt;&gt; IPSC Leaders - Review &amp; take action as needed to address: Delinquency (D), PPM Absence (P), and Unjustified Holds (U)

&gt;&gt;&gt; M&amp;PM Leader (Vaish) - Review and take action as needed to address:  MPM Absence (M)

&gt;&gt;&gt; IP Process Owner (Gutfreund) - Monitor Transfers (T) and Justified Holds (J), escalate issues



Inventions Delayed - Reason (Detailed Definitions) &lt;http://goaero.honeywell.com/dG0q64fZKv0XR00I6d020Q0&gt;

Comments about the IPSC performance metric: 


 - Intended for distribution to IPSC members, distributed on a monthly basis (mid-month for the prior month) and reviewed as needed at IPSC meetings
 - The metric is not a grade, but a way to track IPSC decisions on inventions and assist in troubleshooting an issue that may be an ongoing trend 
 - The IPSC should not be overly concerned with the scoring of an individual month, it is the trend that will need to be monitored (e.g. if an IPSC is not getting 50 percent of the inventions decided over many months, this is an issue and the metrics will support more detailed investigation into the causes)
