    <textOnly>Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Valued Customer}}, 

 We hope this finds you safe and doing the best you can during this COVID-19 challenge. Each year, Aviation International News (AIN) conducts a product support survey asking readers to evaluate aircraft, engines and avionics products with which they have had experience during the prior year. 

 As a long-time customer of our products and services, we would like to invite you to participate in the 2020 AIN Product Support Survey, which should be arriving in your inbox today. It will be sent directly from AIN. 

 As an engines and avionics manufacturer, Honeywell takes this and other industry surveys seriously. Keeping you in the air is what lifts us up and we strive to exceed your expectations by listening to your feedback and implementing the changes that matter most to you. The anonymous results are reviewed by our global leadership. 

 As a result of last yearâ€™s feedback, we have strengthened our flexibility for aircraft on ground (AOG), expanded our field service network to include 120 senior tenured engineers with the support of 80 product experts and hosted more customer events. We continue to improve our processes so you get faster support the way you want it: online or on the phone. 

 Our goal is to achieve top marks in the surveys and we need your feedback to make this happen. 

Kind regards, 
Todd Owens
