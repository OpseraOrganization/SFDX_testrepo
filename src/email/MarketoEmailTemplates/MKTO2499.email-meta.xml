CHANGES TO OUR DISPLAYS PRODUCT LINE MANUFACTURING
Dear Customer:

As part of our normal business process, Honeywell continually evaluates our business lines to determine how they fit into our long-term growth strategy. We’ve signed an exclusive perpetual licensing deal with Ontic, a subsidiary of BBA Aviation, for our Urbana, Ohio-based displays product line.

This deal will end our manufacturing and services operations for the product line at our sites in Urbana, Ohio and Renton, Washington. We are still finalizing the details with Ontic, but expect they will start making and servicing the product line later this year.

We expect the transition to be seamless for you. We have established a dedicated team with leaders from Honeywell Aerospace and Ontic to manage the transition process and ensure there is no break in service or shipments during this period. Our commitment to customer service does not wane during a transition.

We see this exclusive license agreement with Ontic as a benefit for our customers because they are a leader in legacy aircraft support. We’ll continue to provide you with updates, but in the meantime, if you have any questions, please contact your Honeywell representative.
