    <subject>In-Flight Video Streaming that Won’t Leave You Screaming</subject>
    <textOnly>&lt;[[https://aerospace.honeywell.com/]]&gt;

In-flight video streaming at 30,000 feet is a beautiful thing. 


Especially when passengers use it to login to the big shareholder conference, live-chat with an important customer, or watch their favorite team live on opening day.

GoDirect Data Control lets you tighten the pipeline and control the amount of data live-streaming consumes – without impacting the customer experience.
