Dear {{lead.First Name:default=friend}}, 

Earlier this year, Honeywell launched the groundbreaking UV Cabin System to help airlines enhance their cleaning protocols so passengers and crew can travel with more confidence. Now we’re taking this technology to the next level with a new, more compact model ideal for all types of transportation.

 Our system has now been demonstrated or deployed around the globe, and operators have provided us with valuable feedback. 

 The new Honeywell UV Treatment System builds upon the original UV Cabin System with:


	- Increased UVC power, which has been shown in clinical tests to reduce or inactivate various viruses and bacteria on targeted surfaces.
	- Telescoping wings and compact size for a variety of seating configurations.
	- Attached hand wand for galleys, lavatories and cockpit.
	- Now available for buses, monorails, trains, ferries and more!


For an exclusive first look, please join me for a webinar on Tuesday, November 17, 2020, at 10:00 a.m. CST. I’ll share the latest updates on this exciting new product which is expected to be available in mid-November. The webinar will last approximately 60 minutes, and you are welcome to share the invitation with colleagues if you’d like. To register, please click the link below. 
 
 Sincerely,
 Bob Lenz
 Director Offering Management, Safety Systems
