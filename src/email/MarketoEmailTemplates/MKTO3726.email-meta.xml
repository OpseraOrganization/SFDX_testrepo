Get the Clearest Views with Primus Elite
With all the buzz about the Honeywell DU-875 Primus Elite Enhanced Features (PEEF) upgrade, you may be wondering if it is it worth it to upgrade your cockpit or if you should keep flying it as-is. Or maybe you are considering getting a new airplane with the current technology, despite losing substantial equity.

For NASCAR Champion Brad Keselowski, upgrading to Primus Elite was the most economical decision because it upgraded the aircraft to the most current technology and increased his aircraft equity. Keselowski&apos;s pilot, Joey Meier, couldn&apos;t be happier with Brad&apos;s investment and the brighter, clearer, high-resolution picture the DU-875 displays provide.
&quot;My copilot and I have really clear and well-defined images on the new DU-875 liquid crystal displays. And with the PEEF (Primus Elite Enhanced Features) upgrade, we get our charts, georeferenced taxiways, and XM Weather” - Joey Meier, Pilot for NASCAR Champion Brad Keselowski
