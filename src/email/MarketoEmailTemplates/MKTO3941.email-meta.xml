    <subject>What Flight Planning Was Always Meant To Be</subject>
    <textOnly>&lt;[[https://aerospace.honeywell.com/]]&gt;

As I’m sure you know, flight planning can be a real headache.
And frankly, Chief Pilots are really busy and need as much time as possible in the skies, not flight planning.
With Honeywell’s improved GoDirect Flight Planning platform you can view available routes, create, optimize, and file a flight plan in just minutes.
GoDirect Flight Planning helps you:


	- Improve efficiency with route overlays, mapping, and tracking to plan routes that match your mission and planning style
	- Reduce costs with plans that more accurately track fuel consumption with OEM specific performance
	- Increase cleared-as-filed rates with air traffic control with more intelligent route forecasting
	- Save time with faster-computed plans and more direct routes


Don’t waste valuable time when there is a faster way to plan your flights, take a look here &lt;[[http://goaero.honeywell.com/o02kZ00eB00H0Q000XIG0q0]]&gt;.
