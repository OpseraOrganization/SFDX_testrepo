Dear Honeywell Customer, 

Honeywell Aerospace is constantly looking to improve its business processes and operations in support of its service to our customers, and a key element of this is our strategy to create an integrated business platform via the Honeywell International Sàrl (HIS) organization. This change will simplify the way in which you conduct business with Honeywell and deliver a more efficient and effective procurement experience.

As an extension of the existing business environment and structure, the business activity currently linked with the Honeywell Aerospace Singapore Pte. Ltd facility (Avionics R&amp;O Site at Loyang site), will transition to HIS currently targeted for October  2015.

The Singapore Loyang site is an advanced avionics repair and overhaul shop, supporting a number of products including: Flight Management Systems, Ground Proximity Warning, AIMS, Autopilot, Data Management, Recorders, TCAS, Radar, Indicators, Displays and AOA/LGG Fan/Waste Management.

The actions associated with this transition will result in a change to the Honeywell legal entity. Although the Singapore Loyang R&amp;O business will operate at the same site, you will need to update the supplier information in your procurement and accounting systems. 


We appreciate your understanding and cooperation for a seamless transition for you and your organization. Here are the steps you will need to take:



 - Update your Authorized Supplier List (ASL) and internal systems to reflect the new Honeywell International Sàrl (HIS) legal entity. 

 



 - The new supplier address for the Singapore Loyang procurement and accounting transactions is:

 Honeywell International Sàrl
 Aerospace R&amp;O
 Z.A. La Pièce 16,
 1180 Rolle, Switzerland
 
 

 - The amended “Ship To” address for the Honeywell Aerospace Singapore Avionics R&amp;O site is:
 
 Honeywell International Sàrl
 C/O Honeywell Aerospace Singapore Pte. Ltd.,
 2 Loyang Crescent
 508976 Singapore










 - For Contract Customers only: Execute an Amendment Agreement to assign Contracts, to include HIS and/or delete HASPL/ HAPL from Contract, to amend Bank details, delivery /export clauses, notices address etc., where required. Our Contracts team has been in contact with your company to provide additional information to complete this action. 




As we go through this transition, we want to assure you that we have your best interests in mind and we will provide additional details 60, 30 and 5 days prior October 2015. We have attached a frequently asked questions &lt;https://pages3.honeywell.com/rs/641-QIX-912/images/Singapore FAQs 06.27.2015.pdf&gt; document for this transition.

For your information, concurrently as a separate project, we are enhancing the SAP software at other R&amp;O sites in August and October 2015. The August transition will include sites in Tempe, Arizona; Wichita, Kansas; Basingstoke, UK, and Shanghai, China. The October transition will include sites in Renton, Washington; Rocky Mount, North Carolina; Toulouse, France, and Tucson, Arizona. We are providing updates to our customers who conduct business at these sites. 

If you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to contact your Honeywell Customer Business Manager or email us at AeroCPSCommunications@Honeywell.com &lt;mailto:AeroCPSCommunications@Honeywell.com&gt;.

Yours sincerely,



Heath Patrick
