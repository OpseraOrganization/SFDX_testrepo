    <subject>AT&amp;T overage policy - In-flight connectivity statement from Honeywell</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear Valued Customer, 

We want to alert you of a change in the way AT&amp;T is implementing its overage policy that could affect your in-flight connectivity monthly statement from Honeywell. Our goal through this communication is to help inform you and avoid any unplanned costs associated with this change. Our team is standing by to assist you with any questions and to guide you through your options.

Effective immediately, AT&amp;T is charging customers $10 per megabyte when they use airtime in regions called zone B. Areas in zone B can be seen on the map highlighted below &lt;[[https://pages3.honeywell.com/rs/641-QIX-912/images/Coverage Map - AT%26T.png]]&gt;. 



To help you avoid incurring excessive charges we recommend choosing one of these two options below. 

Option A: Click the opt-out button at the bottom of this email to grant approval to have Honeywell disconnect your AT&amp;T service when we detect traffic (1MB) within a zone B region for a 24-hour cycle. Click this option if you wish to avoid excessive charges. If you do not select this option, the service will perform as stated in the terms and conditions. 

 Option B: When operating within zone B regions you have the option to manually turn off mobile GSM data and utilize satellite connectivity as an alternative while on the ground. The service will only shut off automatically if you select option A.
 
Please also be aware if your service active subscription is a North American (NA) plan you will incur roaming charges of $10.00/MB, if you travel outside of NA countries, and use AT&amp;T data. However, you can upgrade to any of the world plans prior to traveling, then return to the North American plan, when your travel is completed. 

 As a reminder, Honeywell has numerous data management tools inside your portal to help you control your experience and manage your cost.Â 

 If you would like more information on data management or want to discuss the above communication, please contact our team at (480) 824-8252. We are ready and thrilled to assist you. 

 Sincerely, 

 Honeywell
