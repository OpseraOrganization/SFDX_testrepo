    <subject>Make Your Cockpit &quot;Cool&quot; Again With Primus Elite!</subject>
    <textOnly>&lt;[[https://aerospace.honeywell.com/]]&gt;  &lt;[[http://standardaero.com/]]&gt;

Your Primus 1000 / 2000 cockpit was the greatest back in the day, but now those days are past. Are you done with those tired, old CRT displays – with their poor color, weak contrast, annoying flicker -- and the way they overheat your cockpit? Those screens are obsolete and no longer serviceable. Now there’s a way to make your 
cockpit “cool” again! The Primus Elite DU-875 liquid crystal display upgrade delivers brighter, clearer, higher resolution images, and 2X the reliability of your old, obsolete DU-870 CRTs. The upgrade is an easy “plug and play” replacement that can be done in less than a day.Right now, StandardAero is offering customers $5,000 off their Primus Elite 
upgrade, in addition to Honeywell trade-in credits of $35,000 per DU-870 unit. This is a potential savings of up to $180,000, but hurry - the Honeywell trade-in credit offer expires on 6/30/2019. 

Contact StandardAero to learn more or request a quote. 





UPGRADE NOW &lt;[[https://pages3.honeywell.com/Primus_Elite_StandardAero_201903.html]]&gt;







*Savings of up to $180,000 is based on Honeywell trade-in credits when you upgrade all five (5) displays on a Falcon 900EX, plus StandardAero&apos;s additional $5,000 savings promotion. Please contact StandardAero to inquire about savings for your specific aircraft model.</textOnly>
