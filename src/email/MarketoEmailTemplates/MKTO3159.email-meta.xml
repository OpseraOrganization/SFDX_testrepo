I&apos;m Joey Meier, one of Brad&apos;s pilots. I&apos;ll be on hand during Daytona Speedweek to introduce you to the Primus Elite upgrade on Brad&apos;s Lear 45. I&apos;m passionate about the cockpit upgrade and can&apos;t wait to show you why.

The demonstrations will cover all Primus Elite certified aircraft: Global Express, Falcon 900EX/C, Legacy 600, Lear 40/45, Citation X (550/560 in near future), Dornier 328, and Gulfstream GIV/GIV-SP/GV. I can also fill you in on Honeywell’s ADS-B solution, HAPP, MSP and GoDirect Flight Services.

If you can&apos;t attend a demonstration, download the infographic &lt;[[https://pages3.honeywell.com/rs/641-QIX-912/images/Primus Elite Value Infographic.pdf]]&gt; that explains the 
benefits of upgrading to Primus Elite.</textOnly>
