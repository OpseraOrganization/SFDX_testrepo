Hi {{lead.First Name:default=edit me}},

We recognize that utilities are tasked with: 



	- Improving worker safety
	- Keeping their members’ costs low by reducing operating costs or increasing operational efficiency
	- Finding effective ways to communicate inspection data from field technicians to office staff


When you work with Honeywell’s drone inspection and data analytics services team &lt;[[https://aerospace.honeywell.com/uav]]&gt;, you get the operational efficiencies of utilizing our drone inspection crew and the having access to our customized customer web portal, where you can view all of your inspection data in one convenient location. 

Our web portal also offers actionable insights on your assets which require monitoring or repair and work orders can be issued right from the portal – helping bridge the gap between field inspector and office staff (pictured above).

Receive the actionable analytics you need to make better business decisions with Honeywell’s drone and data analytics services. For more information or to speak to one of our regional technical managers, please contact us below.
