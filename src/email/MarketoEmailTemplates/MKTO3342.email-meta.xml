    <subject>News about our Coon Rapids, Minnesota Facility</subject>
    <textOnly>&lt;[[https://aerospace.honeywell.com/]]&gt;
Dear Customer:

After an extensive evaluation, we have decided to optimize our operations and close our Coon Rapids, Minnesota facility by the first quarter of 2021 due to an expiring lease. We fully expect this transition will be seamless for you and do not anticipate any disruptions to your orders. 
 
We plan to move the following products to these sites: 



	- Air data management and fuel probe repairs to our Deer Valley, Arizona site; 
	- Commercial inertial reference units, data acquisition units, digital-to-analog adaptors, air data computers, yaw dampers, flame sensors, and indicators to our Clearwater, Florida site; and
	- Engineering and non-supply chain teams to our Stinson site in Minneapolis, Minnesota.



We also plan to transition control sensor products (electronics) from our Golden Valley, Minnesota site to Clearwater. We don’t anticipate any equipment or process moves until Q2 2019 with phases to be completed by Q1 2021. 
In the meantime, if you have any questions, please email your Honeywell point of contact. 


Our commitment to customer service does not wane during a transition. We will continue to provide you with updates. 


Sincerely,
Honeywell Aerospace
