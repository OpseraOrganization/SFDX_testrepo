Pentastar Aviation, a Honeywell Authorized Avionics Dealer, is pleased to offer the opportunity to transform the performance, safety and value of your aircraft with the DU-875 display upgrade. 
 
Unlike many other screens, the DU-875 LCD display units fit your existing system, reducing downtime and additional costs. The best part? The DU-875 display update doesn’t require additional pilot training or modifications to the cockpit. 
 
Update your display today and take advantage of a range of benefits, including: 



	- Reduced cost of ownership thanks to lighter LCD displays that provide a weight reduction of up to 7lbs per unit, which translates to fuel savings

	- Increased display reliability

	- 12-month warranty

	- Growth plan that takes advantage of future technologies and applications



And don’t forget, Honeywell is now offering a trade-in credit of $35,000 per display (no limit), plus special savings on your annual Honeywell Avionics Protection Plan (HAPP) contract when you upgrade before 6/30/19. 
 
Contact Pentastar Aviation today for more information and to take advantage of these great offers.
