Dear {{lead.First Name:default=valued customer}},



Where exactly is your aircraft? Honeywell Datalink Airline Operations Control (AOC) Flight Tracker takes monitoring and tracking to a new level.

AOC Flight Tracker can:



	- Pinpoint an aircraft’s exact location.
	- Monitor the health of critical onboard systems that assess aircraft movement in real time.
	- Let you know if the aircraft changes course unexpectedly.
	- Help the ground-based operations center to immediately understand the abnormal situation on the aircraft.
	- Provide aircraft movement information vital to identifying the nature of an emergency.



AOC Flight Tracker uses onboard sensors, the ACARS network, and Honeywell’s industry-leading Connected Aircraft capabilities. No additional aircraft hardware or software is needed and the Datalink AOC database is easily deployable with no aircraft-level certification required.
