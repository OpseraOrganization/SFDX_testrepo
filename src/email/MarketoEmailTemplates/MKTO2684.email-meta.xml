Dear Valued Customer,



Honeywell’s TFE731 certified engine exchange program is here to help connect you with a certified pre-owned engine to get you back into your jet and onto your next destination as quickly as possible.

Besides, buying through our TFE731 certified engine exchange program is as easy as 1-2-3:

Step 1: Browse our certified, pre-owned inventory and choose the engine that’s right for your budget and aircraft.
Step 2: Provide us with your contact information so that we can get in touch with you.
Step 3: Talk to our GoDirect™ experts to complete your exchange or purchase.

What are you waiting for?

Browse our certified, pre-owned TFE731 inventory and choose the engine that’s right for you today.
