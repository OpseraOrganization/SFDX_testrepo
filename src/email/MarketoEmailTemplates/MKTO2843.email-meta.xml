 Honeywell Aerospace Airlines Operators Conference, Asia Pacific

Dear Customer, 
 
We are hosting two airline operator conferences in Asia this October and hope you can join us for this exciting event! 

Here are three reasons why you should attend these conferences: 

1. Technical and Reliability Updates 
Engage with Honeywell Product Support experts to review product reliability updates across several key Honeywell systems. 

2. Honeywell Technology Updates and Connected Maintenance Strategies 
Meet with our Avionics team, who will present the latest in Safety/Flight Efficiency and Connected Maintenance.

3. Honeywell&apos;s Connected Solutions 
Learn more about our digital experience road map. Honeywell also looks forward to sharing the improvements we have made, largely based on your feedback from recent industry surveys.
