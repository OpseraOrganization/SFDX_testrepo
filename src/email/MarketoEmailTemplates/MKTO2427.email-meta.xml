    <subject>Important Update About Honeywell&apos;s Toronto Facility</subject>
    <textOnly>&lt;[[https://aerospace.honeywell.com/]]&gt;

Dear Honeywell Customer,
Our Honeywell Aerospace plant in Toronto, Canada will be updating their enterprise resource planning system from 17 - 23 May.  We are committed to minimizing the impact as much as possible.
 
During this time, new and existing order status updates will not be visible.  While you will be able to submit new orders, you will not receive a confirmed ship date.  For these new orders, any visible ship date on the MyAerospace Portal or through your customer service representative will reflect your request date until the update is complete on 23 May.  For orders received before 17 May, order status visibility will reflect the planned ship date available before 17 May and will not reflect any changes.
 
This does not impact any AOG shipments. 
 
We apologize in advance for any inconvenience this may cause.

Please share this information with others in your company. If you have questions or concerns, please contact your Honeywell representative or visit MyAerospace &lt;[[https://myaerospace.honeywell.com/contact-us/myaerospace-updates#sort=%40fdisplayname2077%20ascending]]&gt; for updates.  
Sincerely,
Josie Monterosso 
Toronto Plant Director 
Honeywell Aerospace
