Do you know that by 2020 all aircraft must transmit Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) information when flying in European and US air-space? Military aircraft that do not have ADS-B out will be required to request access to fly. Don&apos;t get caught out on critical missions with red tape and forms. Honeywell can help to update your fleet in time if you take action now.Â
