<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 14px; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: 14px; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">During a recent courtesy call by one of my team members to inform you of Honeywell’s Laseref IV upgrade, you mentioned that timing was a concern; however, I wanted to implore how important it is to schedule this upgrade sooner rather than later. <br /><br /> Aside from the fact that your current Laseref II or IIIs are no longer covered by our MSP Avionics plan, Honeywell is providing trade-in incentives for customers who complete the upgrade in 2020. <br /><br /> Also, if your aircraft is scheduled for routine maintenance or isn't flying as a result of COVID-19, this is the perfect time to upgrade your aircraft without impacting your flying schedule.<br /><br /> If you have any questions about what I just shared, please feel free to connect with me directly. I’m here to help. </span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 14px; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"> I look forward to hearing from you. </span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 14px; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"> Sincerely, </span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 14px; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"> Kathy Tyler</span></span>
