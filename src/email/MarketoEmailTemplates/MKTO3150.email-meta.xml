    <subject>Passenger Safety Goes Well Beyond Mandate Compliance</subject>

Automatic Dependent Surveillance - Broadcast (ADS-B)
Increasing safety and efficiency in today’s congested airspace
Dear valued customer,

 The 2020 Mandate requirement for Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B Out) is firm, and non-compliance with the mandate will ground your fleet in 2020. But for a carrier like yours, retrofit decisions are not forced solely by mandates, rather they are driven by your commitment to passenger safety and need for better cost efficiency. 



	- ADS-B Out facilitates reduced fuel consumption and increased cargo payload by allowing tighter aircraft spacing and higher traffic capacity in congested airspace

	- ADS-B Out leads to greater safety by enabling an aircraft to use precise GPS data for enhanced traffic situational awareness 



Honeywell has a broad range of products and solutions with ADS-B Out capabilities including our DO-260B compliant transponder, GPS position source, and aircraft updates. Our teams globally are fully equipped to retrofit ADS-B and make your airline safer, more cost efficient and mandate compliant.

As the 2020 deadline approaches, you will face lengthy delays and component shortages if you delay your decision to retrofit any further. Hence it is very important that you contact Honeywell at your earliest opportunity to schedule a date for the ADS-B retrofit.







Schedule a date for the ADS-B retrofit &lt;[[https://aerospace.honeywell.com/en/pages/adsb-2020vision]]&gt;






Sincerely,

Team Honeywell Aerospace</textOnly>
