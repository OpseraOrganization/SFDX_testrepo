    <subject>News about our Albuquerque, New Mexico Site</subject>
    <textOnly>&lt;[[https://aerospace.honeywell.com/]]&gt;
Dear Customer,   &lt;[[http://goaero.honeywell.com/R00q00oI0G002000QQXh7Z0]]&gt;

As part of our normal business process, Honeywell continually looks for ways to better serve customers more efficiently and cost-effectively. After an extensive evaluation, we have decided to end manufacturing, repair and overhaul, and manufacturing engineering operations at our site in Albuquerque, New Mexico by the end of 2019. 
 
Assembly, test, repair, and overhaul work will move to our Phoenix, Arizona Deer Valley site; circuit card assembly will move to our Clearwater, Florida site; and our engineering labs will move to our Deer Valley and Moca, Puerto Rico sites. These actions create a more centralized engineering skillset, allowing for more flexibility and positioning us for anticipated growth.   
 
We don’t anticipate any equipment or work moves until the third quarter of 2019, and then that activity will occur in phases to be completed by the end of the year. 
 
We fully expect this transition to be seamless for you. We have established a dedicated transition team to manage the transition process and ensure there is no disruption in service or shipments during this period. Our commitment to customer service does not wane during a transition.  

We’ll continue to provide you with updates over the next several months. In the meantime, if you have any questions, please contact your Honeywell Business Manager. We are always working to give you the quality and the service you deserve. 
 
 Sincerely, 
 
 Honeywell Aerospace
