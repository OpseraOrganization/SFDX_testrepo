    <subject>Master Production Schedule Update</subject>
    <textOnly>July 31, 2020 

 Dear Valued Supplier, 

Our shared commercial customers continue to experience dramatic impacts from the COVID-19 situation. For many customers, this has manifested in delays and interruptions in development, demand, production, repair, and delivery of aircraft and other aerospace systems. 

 These circumstances are unprecedented and the unforeseeable decrease in customer demand is beyond Honeywell’s control. For this reason, Honeywell will be executing additional Master Production Schedule (MPS) adjustments immediately. This change allows us to better communicate our true demand with you as we realign our supply base capacity from areas where the demand has softened to areas where demand is stable and past-due backlog recovery is required. 

 We recognize these changes can pose challenges, and we recognize that they are essential for you to align your current capacity towards the greatest needs. This is an ongoing process, and we will continue to update our production plans based on the material plans we receive to meet the expectations of our shared customers. 

 We also need your continued support in ensuring the required material arrives on time. When component supply is not received from all suppliers, it increases the demand volatility across the entire supply base, which we need to jointly minimize 

 Additionally, most critical among our obligations to our customers is the obligation to fulfill orders under the Defense Priorities and Allocation System (DPAS), pursuant to the Defense Production Act. As a reminder, you and your applicable sub-tier suppliers are required to prioritize materials and production and deliver DPAS-rated orders, in accordance with applicable law and pursuant to recent guidance from the Department of Defense. 

 We must work together to minimize unnecessary disruptions across the supply chain, and we expect you to promptly acknowledge and accept these demand signal changes. Please work with your respective Honeywell procurement contact regarding any concerns or questions related to this activity. It’s important that all supplier commitment dates are current and accurate. 

 Once again, we are all in this together. Thank you for all your support in helping deliver products for our joint-end customers&amp;mdsah;we couldn’t do it without you. 

 Sincerely, 

 Bob Buddecke
