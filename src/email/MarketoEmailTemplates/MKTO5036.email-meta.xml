    <textOnly>Dear Customer, 

Honeywell will update our Spares, Universal Flat Rate (UFR), and SPEX Exchange catalog pricing on select parts effective April 15, 2021. To view the published part numbers impacted by this pricing update, access the MyAerospace downloadable catalogs after April 1, 2021 and filter on the column ‘Revised List Price’. Parts constrained by the Boeing and Airbus product support agreements are excluded from these price adjustments. 

 To prevent order disruptions, please take the following actions:



	- After April 1st 2021, access the updated pricing on Honeywell MyAerospace and downloadable Spares, UFR, &amp; SPEX catalog Files.
	- Effective April 15, 2021, our new prices will be incorporated in MyAerospace Online Ordering and EDI interfaces.


Please review the new pricing and apply it to all new purchase orders created on or after April 15, 2021. Also please update your pricing system with the new pricing information.
