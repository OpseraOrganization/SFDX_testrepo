    <subject>Selling an Aircraft? Make It Irresistible to Buyers Through a New Tax Perk</subject>
    <textOnly>&lt;[[https://aerospace.honeywell.com/]]&gt;

If You&apos;re Selling an Aircraft, Don&apos;t Miss Out On This Tax Benefit

Want to sell your aircraft fast and at a better price? Upgrade it! 

New United States tax rules allow your company to write off up to 100 percent of equipment purchases for business aircraft, a major benefit. The changes are part of tax code changes approved last year. Previously, newly purchased aircraft could only receive up to a 50 percent deduction, and upgrading or buying used aircraft had fewer immediate benefits. 

Thanks to the changes, you can make your aircraft irresistible to buyers by adding exciting features like Honeywell&apos;s JetWave high-speed Wi-fi, cutting-edge avionics or an advanced weather radar. Or upgrade the engine and mechanical components with our Connected Maintenance technology. 

Want to know more about the tax changes and how they can work for you? Click below and we&apos;ll connect you with one of our product experts. Or come talk to us at Booth 2600 during NBAA&apos;s Business Aviation Convention and Exhibition in Orlando, Florida!
