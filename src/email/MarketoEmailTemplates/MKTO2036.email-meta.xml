Dear Valued Customer, 
I wanted to take the opportunity and ask you: do you have a 2020 vision ?
Here are a few FACTS that will convince you to act quickly on upgrading your aircraft:



	- The ADS-B Mandate is fast approaching!



 By 2020, all aircraft operating in the U.S and Europe will be required to transmit ADS-B positioning information in compliance with DO-260B — the deadline is January 1st for U.S airspace, June 8th for European.


	- Time is running out!



There are literally thousands of non-compliant aircraft requiring upgrade prior to the 2020 deadline. With upgrades taking in excess of 100 man hours per aircraft time is running out.  


	- Your operation is a risk if you are not compliant!



 After the 2020 deadline, non-compliant aircraft could be grounded! Even if you’re not grounded operators will be subjected to delays, inefficient routing and higher fuel burn. Are you willing to take the risk? 


	- The longer you wait – the more it will cost!



 As the 2020 mandates approach the cost of the upgrade will increase as parts and hanger availability declines. If you haven&apos;t budgeted for ADS-B in 2017 make sure you do for 2018! 



	- HONEYWELL CAN HELP!



Do you have a crystal-clear plan for securing the required hardware and upgrading your fleet in time to comply with these mandates? 
If not, we are  here to help. 

Also, if you plan to have your aircraft sold, as a differentiation versus other aircraft they might consider, upgrade now to produce added value for your buyer and free up some time for them.
