    <textOnly>Hi {{lead.First Name:default=there}}, 

 If you’re in the market for a non-ITAR, gyrocompass-grade IMU or INS (IMU + ECTOS Navigation Software) to improve your system’s overall performance and replace your existing HG1700 IMU, Honeywell’s new HG5700 MEMS IMU &lt;[[https://aerospace.honeywell.com/en/learn/products/sensors/hg5700-inertial-measurement-unit?utm_source=email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=20_rmus_jj]]&gt; is an affordable, drop-in replacement designed for your application. 

 For guidance and control applications where precision pointing and navigation are important to the success of your mission, our HG5700’s three ring laser gyroscopes, three vibrating beam accelerometers and electronics combine to provide one of the most rugged and accurate inertial navigation solutions on the market today.
