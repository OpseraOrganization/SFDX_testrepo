    <subject>MST 70B ADS-B Upgrade Reduces Installation Costs 25%</subject>
    <textOnly>&lt;[[http://www.bendixking.com/]]&gt;

Attention: Citation 560 Owners
Did you know – the MST 70B upgrade offers a slide-in replacement for the MST 67A, which saves up to 25% in installation, mounting hardware and wiring harness fees? Additionally, the MST 70B is one of the lowest-priced solutions, at $55,900 for two transponders. And for an additional flat fee, your ADS-B upgrade can be covered by HAPP (Honeywell Avionics Protection Plan) which covers all repairs, in and out of warranty.
For a limited time, upgrade your MST 67A transponder to the MST 70B ADS-B and get a $50,000 discount on the AeroVue Integrated Flight Deck when it becomes available for the Citation 560 in late 2019.*
AeroVue Integrated Flight Display
 BendixKing’s AeroVue is a complete avionics retrofit flight deck solution for Citation 560 owners and operators, and is expected to be certified on the Citation 560 platform by the end of 2019.
Don’t delay, as this promotion ends September 30, 2019.
