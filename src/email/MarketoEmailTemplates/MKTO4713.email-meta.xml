    <subject>Honeywell Aerospace Anniston, Alabama - Wave 3 Cutover Reminder</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear Honeywell Customer, 


Honeywell Aerospace recently provided an update regarding our Anniston site closure. In that communication, Honeywell provided the complete cut-over schedule and instructions on how to prepare for the upcoming transition. A copy of that communication can be found here &lt;[[https://pages3.honeywell.com/rs/641-QIX-912/images/Original Honeywell Annison Communication.pdf]]&gt;.  

This notice is to remind you of the upcoming ship-to changes required before September 7, 2020 for Wave 3 part numbers. Repairs Site Capabilities &lt;[[https://aerospace2.honeywell.com/onlineordering/repair-capabilities/]]&gt; will be updated on September 4, 2020, to enable updates prior to the September 7 ship-to change.

The part numbers affected in this Wave 1 &amp; Wave 2 transition can be located here. &lt;[[https://pages3.honeywell.com/rs/641-QIX-912/images/Honeywell_Anniston_Impacted-Parts-by-Wave_82020.xlsx]]&gt;

To minimize delays, please follow these guidelines and actions:

New Repair Orders

Shipment to the new repair stations for Wave 3 part numbers begins on September 7, 2020. Honeywell Repairs Site Capabilities will be activated to facilitate shipment to the new repair stations on September 4, 2020. Anniston will no longer induct Wave 3 parts for repair after September 14, 2020. 


	- For Wave 3 units received in Anniston after 9/14/20, the orders will be forwarded to the new repair station. The Honeywell Customer Service team will request an updated PO with the new repair station address to ensure the 8130 tag matches the repair station on your Purchase Order. 
	- Units received in Anniston after 10/7/20 (30-days since 9/7/20 cutover) will be returned to the sender, for routing to the proper Honeywell Repair Station.



EDI Order Management Impact (AeroXchange, B2B Aero): 

For customers using EDI/M2M order management solutions, the option to create orders for the new repair station will be available on or before 9/4/2020. Please note that the link between EDI/M2M orders created in Anniston but requiring transition to the new repair station will be disconnected. These orders will need to be completed manually with any remaining actions administered through the CSR organization (AeroRepairs@Honeywell.com &lt;[[mailto:AeroRepairs@Honeywell.com]]&gt;). 

Unfinished Anniston Repair Orders Moving to New Repair Station: 

 A small number of repair orders that started work in Anniston will need to be transferred to the new site for repair completion, once the equipment moves to the new repair station. These units will go on hold once received at the new site, to seek Customer preference on finishing repair at the new repair station. 

 There are 2 options for addressing these impacted orders, your Honeywell Customer Service Representative will reach out if your orders are impacted: 



	- Provide an updated/new PO with the new site address.


	- Honeywell Customer Service Representative will provide a list of orders that need to be updated.


	- Provide e-mail approval to allow work completion at the new site under the Anniston PO.


	- The Honeywell CSR will use this approval to clear all units on hold for revised/new PO and ship from the new repair location under the original Anniston PO. Please note: 8130 tag will be from the new repair station, not Anniston.





What to do now?


	- Ensure the new repair stations identified in the Transition Wave list are qualified on your approved supplier list and update the Part Numbers in Wave 3 for shipment to the new repair station starting 9/7/2020. Anniston will no longer receive units after 9/14/2020 for Wave 3 outlines, they will be forwarded to the new repair station for processing.
	- If you need to conduct an on-site audit, please email Norman.Dubay@Honeywell.com &lt;[[mailto:Norman.Dubay@honeywell.com]]&gt; to request an audit.
