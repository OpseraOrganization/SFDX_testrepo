    <subject>The future is what we all make it—a small gift for your company</subject>
    <textOnly>Hello {{lead.First Name:default=edit me}},

As we all work through these current challenges, we know that a bright, optimistic future is ahead. We stand ready to support you as you return to flying.

I’ve found in work and home life that learning a new skill or hobby and educating myself in new areas bring optimism and exciting anticipation, and they always seem to be worthwhile endeavors. Honeywell wanted to share this philosophy with you by providing a small gift: a year’s subscription to MasterClass for your company. You can benefit from this learning platform or perhaps gift it to an inspirational employee or colleague on your team.

In this environment, transforming the future means learning and changing what we can today, and we’re honored to include you as part of this.
