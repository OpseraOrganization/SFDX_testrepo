    <textOnly>Honeywell Repair Order Processing Policy
In an ongoing effort to reduce order processing holds and improve your customer order turnaround times, Honeywell Aerospace is re-communicating our policy for processing repair orders.  While we have always maintained a 10-day Return As Is (RAI) policy, Honeywell will begin strictly enforcing the policy starting on June 30, 2014. The key elements of the policy as are as follows:



 - A funded Purchase Order (P.O.) based on either an established Contract price, or if not under a Long Term Contract, then a Universal Flat Rate (UFR) price, will need to be submitted at time of order for all incoming units.
 

 - For parts where no Contracted price or Universal Flat Rate (UFR) pricing is available, a funded Purchase Order (PO) should be submitted with the published Test, Teardown, Evaluation (TTE) fee. After the unit is evaluated, Honeywell will provide a notification with the Time and Material price.
 

 - If units are received without a funded Purchase Order, customers will be contacted and asked to submit the properly funded P.O. immediately. 


 - Orders will be placed on an internal hold for 10 days while awaiting the P.O. 
 - Customers will receive 1 additional follow-up email/phone call.  
 - If no funded P.O. is received in 10 days, per the standard Honeywell RAI policy, the unit will be Returned As Is to the customer without any testing or evaluation performed. 
 - No fees will be invoiced.






(It should be noted that in cases when Warranty coverage is requested, the standard adjudication will take place. For instance, where Warranty is denied, customers will be notified to submit a funded-P.O. to allow repair work to continue and the RAI process will apply accordingly.)

As part of the Honeywell commitment to our customers, we will be instituting the following internal improvements: 



 - More robust internal procedures for handling escalated items; such as errors or disputes, to ensure timely resolution 



 - Please note that customer escalations must be made back to Honeywell within the 10 day time frame to avoid return of product






 - Standardized procedures for submittal of all quote approvals, funded P.O.&apos;s and/or information requests for all Honeywell Aerospace sites: 


 - Quotes approvals and communications online at www.myaerospace.com &lt;http://www.myaerospace.com/&gt;
 - Direct response to original email received from D&amp;Srepairs@honeywell.com &lt;mailto:D&amp;SRepairs@Honeywell.com&gt;
 - Contact Honeywell directly at AeroR&amp;OD&amp;S@Honeywell.com &lt;mailto:AeroR&amp;OD&amp;S@Honeywell.com&gt;
