    <subject>Honeywell Transitioning Work From Our Anniston, Alabama Facility By March 2021</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear Customer, 

Honeywell continually evaluates our business portfolio to optimize and better serve our customers. After a thorough evaluation, we have decided to move most Repair and Overhaul (R&amp;O) work from our Anniston, Alabama facility on Cliff Garrett Drive to our Tempe, Arizona site. We plan to close our Anniston facility by March 2021. Low volume repair work will be absorbed into the Honeywell R&amp;O network.Â 

The impacted parts list &lt;[[https://pages3.honeywell.com/rs/641-QIX-912/images/Anniston Transition Part List.xlsx]]&gt; is provided for your use and review. Overall, we expect these changes to be seamless for you and are committed to zero interruptions in service. We have established a dedicated transition team composed of functional experts and leaders to manage the transition process and ensure there is no break in service or shipments during this period. Our commitment to customer service does not wane during a transition. 

We will continue to keep you updated, providing plenty of notice and instructions for changes that will affect you or actions that you will need to complete in the coming months. In the meantime, if you have any questions, please contact your Honeywell point of contact. 

We are always working to give you the quality and the service you deserve. 

Sincerely, 

Honeywell Aerospace
