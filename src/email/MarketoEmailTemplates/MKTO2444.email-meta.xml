    <subject>New Approaches, New Displays and New Upgrade Options with Duncan Aviation and CDS/R</subject>
    <textOnly>&lt;[[https://aerospace.honeywell.com/]]&gt;      &lt;[[https://www.duncanaviation.aero/]]&gt;

Did you know that Honeywell’s Primus Epic® control display system/retrofit (CDS/R) upgrade provides a path for Falcon 900A/B operators to add FMS 6.1? Honeywell’s FMS 6.1 software upgrade provides pilots with WAAS-LPV, giving them access to approximately 1,888 airports across the United States. 
 
CDS/R also gives operators the option to add Honeywell’s SmartRunway® and SmartLanding® software, which was created to: 



	- Increase situational awareness during taxi, take-off and landing; stabilize approaches;

	- Decrease the risk of runway incursions and excursions;

	- Support heads-up operations and more. 


Matched with new displays and FMS 6.1 software upgrade, the CDS/R upgrade provides a new level of safety and convenience to the cockpit. 
 
To show Honeywell’s commitment to supporting CDS/R, Falcon 900A/B operators who upgrade are eligible for one free year of HAPP after installation has been complete, and a $10,000 discount off years 2 and 3 of their 3-year or 5-year contract. As an added benefit, Honeywell is offering fixed year-over-year pricing on 5-year contracts.
