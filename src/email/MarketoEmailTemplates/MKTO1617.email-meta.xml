Q2 HAPP Promotion for Honeywell Channel Partners


Help your Learjet 40 and 45 operators protect more than $850,000 of avionics in their aircraft with Honeywell’s Avionics Protection Plan. For a limited time, operators can save 15% on a new HAPP contract when they sign up before June 30. 

This is also a great time to tell operators about the DU-870 to DU-875 LCD display replacement program option, which allows operators to exchange a failed DU-870 for a DU-875.  

As an added bonus to this HAPP offer, Honeywell channel partners can take advantage of a 20% margin when they sell this program.
 
Learn more about this exclusive program while there’s still time or contact your Honeywell HAPP sales manager today to take advantage of this special offer. Act now, this offer expires June 30.
