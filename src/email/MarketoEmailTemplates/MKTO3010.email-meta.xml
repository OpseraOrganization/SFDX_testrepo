Take Your Productivity to New Heights with Always On Wi-Fi from JetWave™


Taking a flight on your corporate jet used to mean signing offline for several hours or trying to connect to super-slow, always-dropping wireless networks. Now, in-flight Wi-Fi lets you stay productive, connected and entertained throughout your flight – but only if you choose the right Wi-Fi solution.

Honeywell’s premier in-flight connectivity solution hardware, JetWave™, powered by Inmarsat’s fast and reliable Jet ConneX service, is designed to give you the ultimate in-flight entertainment experience. Whether you need to download large attachments, videoconference with colleagues or customers, or stay connected with friends and family, JetWave gives you a superior onboard Wi-Fi experience – both on the tarmac and at 30,000 feet.

And, thanks to recent changes within U.S. tax rules, you can now write off up to 100% of equipment purchases for business aircraft, including JetWave. There’s never been a better time than now to upgrade your in-flight Wi-Fi capabilities.

Contact StandardAero to learn more about this upgrade today.
