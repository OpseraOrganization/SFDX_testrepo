    <subject>Where to find TruTrak products and how to order</subject>
    <textOnly>&lt;[[http://www.bendixking.com/]]&gt;

As you may have read, we announced &lt;[[https://www.bendixking.com/en/news-listing/2019/july/honeywell-to-acquire-trutrak-flight-systems]]&gt; the exciting news at Oshkosh 2019 that TruTrak became part of the BendixKing family.

 We are reaching out to you directly, as 
you had expressed interest in TruTrak products prior to the acquisition, and wanted to update you on where to find - and purchase - these products on the BendixKing website.

 The popular PMA Vizion for certified aircraft is now called the AeroCruze 100 autopilot, and BendixKing is carrying over the three form factors to 
accommodate 2” round, 3” round and flat pack panel cutouts: https://www.bendixking.com/en/products/aerocruze-100 &lt;[[https://www.bendixking.com/en/products/aerocruze-100]]&gt;

 The Vizion autopilot for experimental aircraft is now called the xCruze 100, also offered in 
the same three form factors as the AeroCruze 100: https://www.bendixking.com/en/products/xcruze-100 &lt;[[https://www.bendixking.com/en/products/xcruze-100]]&gt;
