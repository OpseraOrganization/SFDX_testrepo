    <subject>Final Arrival and Cross-Check | Our New Website</subject>
    <textOnly>We have exciting news about our website as we continue to elevate your digital experience with us. 

 In mid-October, please check out and bookmark the new Aerospace website &lt;[[https://aerospace.honeywell.com/]]&gt;. Our new website will redefine how you interact with us. You will be able to search all aspects of your online experience – product, service and platform research; order status; pricing and availability; technical support and training; and recent news and events. We are posting several ‘how-to’ resources to highlight these changes. 

 Rest assured, if you have used our platform before or have older pages bookmarked, you can still log in and use the portal applications just like before. 

 This is the beginning of our digital journey roadmap, and we apologize in advance if you experience any difficulties with the site. In fact, we’ve created a resource &lt;[[https://aerospace.honeywell.com/en/pages/resources]]&gt; should you require any assistance or wish to send us feedback &lt;[[https://myaerospace.honeywell.com/contact-us/forms/website-issues/website-feedback]]&gt;. For more information about timing and updates, please watch for notifications on myaerospace.honeywell.com &lt;[[https://myaerospace.honeywell.com/]]&gt;.</textOnly>
