    <textOnly>Hi {{lead.First Name:default=there}},

 Did you know you can subscribe to Honeywell product reliability updates? This new feature went live in April and now you can be notified each month when the updated documents are available on the Honeywell Aerospace product reliability updates webpage. We will also let you know about any new programs opened over the last 30 days or any closed programs that now have the fix available. This is a great way to stay informed in-between the technical webinars hosted by the Honeywell In-Service Engineering team. 

This document &lt;[[https://pages3.honeywell.com/rs/641-QIX-912/images/Product Reliability Updates Subscription Feature.pdf]]&gt; provides detailed instructions on how to easily subscribe to product reliability updates, or you can view our how-to video here &lt;[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SirtJ8ukosw]]&gt;.Â 

Sincerely, 

Honeywell Global Technical Operations Team</textOnly>
