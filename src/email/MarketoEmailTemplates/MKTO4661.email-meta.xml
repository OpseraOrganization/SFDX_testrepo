    <textOnly>The DU-875 Display Upgrade for Learjet 40/45 
 by Honeywell and Pentastar Aviation
Improve your pilot’s view and add instant value to your aircraft with the DU-875 upgrade for Learjet 40/45 by Honeywell and Pentastar Aviation.
Replace one or all of your CRT DU-870 displays with this simple “plug and play” replacement, that allows for quick and easy installation using the same connector without additional wiring. 
When you upgrade your cockpit, you also receive many benefits: 


	- Reduced cost of ownership, represented by increased display reliability (2x more than the old CRT&apos;s) and system weight reduction (each display is 7lbs lighter than the existing DU-870 and the cooling system is no longer required)
	- Maintains full cockpit integration – no need for pilot training due to retention of current display formats, symbology and color sets 
	- Growth plan that takes advantage of future technologies and applications – Primus Elite 


Avoid obsolescence and save up to $140,000* when you take advantage of this limited time trade-in credit.
