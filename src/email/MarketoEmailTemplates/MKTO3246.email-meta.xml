    <subject>Update Your Systems to Order LTS101 Engine Repairs</subject>
    <textOnly>&lt;[[https://aerospace.honeywell.com/]]&gt;
Dear Customer, 
As part of our normal business process, Honeywell continually looks for ways to better serve customers more efficiently and cost-effectively. After an extensive evaluation, we have decided to move all repair and overhaul operations from our Greer, South Carolina facility. The transition which includes the LTS101 engine product line is expected to be complete later this summer. 
Moving forward, repair and overhaul services for the LTS101 engine product line will be provided by our authorized channel partners: Intermountain Turbine Services and Airwork. Honeywell remains committed to the LTS101 engine product line and we plan to continue to support repair and overhaul on 
LTS101 engines through our channel partner network for many years. This information only affects aftermarket repair and overhaul services. There are no planned changes to the production line.
A review of past orders indicates that you have placed production or repair orders for impacted
