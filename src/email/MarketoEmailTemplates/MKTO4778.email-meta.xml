    <subject>Why do customers upgrade to Laseref IV?</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi {{lead.First Name:default=there}}, 

Since we haven’t had the chance to connect, I thought I’d share some feedback we’ve received from our customers on why they upgraded to Laseref IV: 



	- Improved cost of maintenance with a modular design and assembly 
	- MTBF (Mean Time Between Failures) consistently exceeds 40,000 hours 
	- MTBUR (Mean Time Between Unscheduled Removals) more than 20,000 hours since service entry in 1997 
	- 25 pounds lighter than LASEREF II and 10 pounds lighter than LASEREF III 
	- 30 percent improvement in demonstrated reliability 


If you have any questions about what I just shared, please feel free to connect with me directly. I’m here to help. 
 
 I look forward to hearing from you. 

 Sincerely,
