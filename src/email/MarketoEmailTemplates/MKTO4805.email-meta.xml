We have completed the process of migrating our Predictive Trend Monitoring and Diagnostics (PTMD) solution into Honeywell Forge. The next step would be to start an automatic redirect from your legacy PTMD login to the new login in 30 days. As per previous communications, the new application is hosted here:


	- Visit: https://aerospace1.honeywell.com/ &lt;[[https://aerospace1.honeywell.com/]]&gt;
	- Launch Connected Maintenance
	- User name: use your existing user name
	- Password: use your existing password


Please make sure you bookmark the new application URL and share it with colleagues who are using PTMD. In about 30 days, we will start automatically redirecting you from the legacy login page to the new one. If you experience any problems, our support team is available for your questions.

Note: there is no additional cost associated with the transition to Honeywell Forge.
