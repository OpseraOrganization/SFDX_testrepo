    <subject>Happy Holidays from BendixKing!</subject>
    <textOnly>With the closing of this year, we would like to take the opportunity to thank you for being a loyal and important BendixKing customer.

 This year we have made several announcements &lt;[[https://www.bendixking.com/en/news-listing]]&gt; - most notably the acquisition of TruTrak Flight Systems - and look forward to adding more to our product offerings in 
2020. 

 We have also added to our global distribution team: EDMO and TWA join VSE and Aviall. These carefully chosen partners have been added to better support you now and for many years to come.

For our final addition of the year, more airframes have been added to the AeroCruze 230 STC. Check our product page &lt;[[https://www.bendixking.com/en/products/aerocruze-230]]&gt; for the complete list.

 On behalf of the entire BendixKing organization, Authorized Repair Partners &lt;[[https://www.bendixking.com/en/pages/repair-partners]]&gt; and Distributors, we wish you and your families a very safe and happy holiday 
season.</textOnly>
