    <subject>Now’s the best time to upgrade to Laseref IV and here’s why</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi {{lead.First Name:default=there}}, 

During a recent courtesy call by one of my team members to inform you of Honeywell’s Laseref IV upgrade, you mentioned that timing 
was a concern; however, I wanted to implore how important it is to schedule this upgrade sooner rather than later. 

 Aside from the fact that your current Laseref II or IIIs are no longer covered by our MSP Avionics plan, Honeywell is providing trade-in incentives for customers who complete the upgrade in 2020. 

 Also, if your aircraft is scheduled for routine maintenance or isn&apos;t flying as a result of COVID-19, this is the perfect time to upgrade your aircraft without impacting your flying schedule.

 If you have any questions about what I just shared, please feel free to connect with me directly. I’m here to help. 

 I look forward to hearing from you. 

 Sincerely, 

 Kathy Tyler</textOnly>
