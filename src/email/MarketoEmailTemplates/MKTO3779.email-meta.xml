Because the Unexpected Can Happen

Designed for business and general aviation, Honeywell&apos;s Maintenance Service Plan – Avionics (formally known as HAPP) is an extended warranty program that provides a broader coverage solution for a wide range of components across your aircraft. Under the new program, coverage extends to the cockpit, environmental systems, cabin pressure control systems, as well as other valuable and critical aircraft components, to get you back in the sky quickly during urgent Aircraft on Ground (AOG) situations. 

With Maintenance Service Plan from Honeywell on your side, you have all the tools you need to handle unforeseen issues and 
keep your aircraft in service – without breaking the bank. Only Honeywell has the experience, global reach, and resources to protect your investment and ensure trouble-free operations and aircraft availability.
