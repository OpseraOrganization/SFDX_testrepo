Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Customer}},

We’ve all been there. Sitting in the airport or on the tarmac suffering through long flight delays. No one can control the weather, of course, but what if there was a way to predict and mitigate aircraft maintenance-related delays for your airline, before they happen? Honeywell’s Connected Maintenance solutions can do just that. By capturing and analyzing data, our solution puts the right information and recommendations into the right hands. This allows ground crews to better prepare and address maintenance and repair work before failures occur, reducing aircraft downtime, disruptions and costs. Let Honeywell tell you more. &lt;[[https://aerospace.honeywell.com/en/products/auxiliary-power-and-thermal/connected-apu]]&gt;
