    <subject>Introducing the DU-875 Upgrade offered by Banyan Air Service</subject>
    <textOnly>Frustrated by failures and exchange costs on your DU-870 displays? Stop supporting your aircraft with spares that have a limited life span. Instead, improve your vision and add instant value to your aircraft by upgrading to Honeywell Primus Elite DU-875 LCD displays with Banyan Air Service. Below are some benefits that you will have with Honeywell`s DU-875 screen. 



	- Updates cockpit to latest technology with a quick &quot;plug and play&quot; display
	- Removes obsolescence issue facing DU-870 CRTs
	- Lowers your cost of operation - increases reliability by 2X and lowers weight by seven pounds per display unit
	- Brings a brighter, clearer, high resolution picture to the pilots that runs cooler and creates less heat in the cockpit
	- Operators can replace display units one at a time upon failure or all displays at once
	- Positions aircraft to later add operational features as part of the Primus Elite upgrade such as electronic charts, advanced maps, maintenance pages, optional Weather XM® information, and even Synthetic Vision (SVS).
