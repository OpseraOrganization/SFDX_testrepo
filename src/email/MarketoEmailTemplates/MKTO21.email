<p><span>Dear <span>{{lead.First Name:default=edit me}} {{lead.Last Name:default=edit me}},</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Honeywell is working to improve our estimated ship date and notifications process for repair and overhaul customers. We would like to include your opinions to help guide those efforts.</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>We&rsquo;ve hired an independent market research firm, Lynx Research, to conduct an online survey. &nbsp;If you qualify and complete the full survey, you will receive a gift card for the amount of $25 USD, as a token of our appreciation. <strong>You will have the option to &ldquo;opt out&rdquo; of the incentive at the end of the survey should your company policy disallow incentives. </strong></span></p>
<p><span>We encourage you to respond quickly, as this survey will be available only until a predetermined number of responses have been received. </span></p>
<p><span>To complete the survey, simply click on the link below, or copy the entire web address into the address bar of your web browser.&nbsp; Please make sure you copy the whole link.</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>URL: </span>{{lead.Survey Link:default=edit me}}</p>
<p><span>Please be assured that no one will attempt to sell you anything as a result of participating in this survey.&nbsp; The findings will be used for research purposes only, and the identities of the participants will be kept completely confidential. If you have any questions, please email Lori Goodman at </span><a href="mailto:LGoodman@lynxresearch.net"><span>LGoodman@lynxresearch.net</span></a><strike><u></u></strike></p>
<p>Thank you in advance for completing our survey.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Sincerely,</span></p>
<p>The Honeywell Customer Experience Team</p></div>
