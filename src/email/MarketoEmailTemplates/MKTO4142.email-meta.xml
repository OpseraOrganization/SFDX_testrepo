    <subject>Why Right Now is The Perfect Time to Enroll in an MSP Plan! ✈</subject>

The Maintenance Service Plan (MSP) from Honeywell is a solution that makes it easy for you to take control of unexpected repair expenses and keep your aircraft where it belongs – in the sky. With selectable options, you can choose the level of coverage that is the right fit for you across a wide range of service capabilities, making MSP a cost-effective and practical alternative for managing future avionics maintenance expenses. 

With the new year upon us, this is a great time to enroll in an MSP program with Honeywell so you can enter 2020 with a clear view of your maintenance budget and protection you can count on.
