    <subject>Hello from Honeywell User Experience Team</subject>
    <textOnly>&lt;[[https://aerospace.honeywell.com/]]&gt;

As we continue to evaluate our future MyAerospace website for both navigation and design, we’ll be conducting a 1:1 session, one-hour moderated study that will take place in the next couple weeks. Our team is looking for users of MyAerospace portal to participate in this research activity. By participating in this study, you will help us determine our future path and receive a $50 American Express Gift Card for your time. Payment will be made after participation.
To take part, please email Claudia.Guerrero@Honeywell.com &lt;[[mailto:Claudia.Guerrero@Honeywell.com?subject=MyAerospace Research]]&gt; ASAP. We are conducting the user experience study in the week of September 16. We value your feedback and we will make every effort to reply to you as soon as possible. If we do not contact you within five business days, this is due to the fact we have received a high volume of emails and the study has reached its maximum number of participants.
We look forward to hearing from you!
Best,
 Claudia</textOnly>
