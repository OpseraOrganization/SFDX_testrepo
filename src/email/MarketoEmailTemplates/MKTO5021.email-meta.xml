    <textOnly>Hello {{lead.First Name}}

 Thank you for interest in Honeywell.  

 A member of the sales team will be in touch with you shortly. In the meantime, we wanted to ask a few quick questions to ensure you receive the best service and information.  

 If you prefer, tell us more about your inquiry so that we can best serve you.



	- What is your company role?
	- What is the specific need we may help you address?
	- Is your question technical related or more transactional (quote/information)?  


We look forward to speaking with you soon.  

 Kind Regards,

 Perry Pelitera
