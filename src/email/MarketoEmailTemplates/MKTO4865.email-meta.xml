Dear Valued Supplier, 

Our records reflect that you have an outstanding action related to compliance with DFARS 252.204-7020 &lt;[[https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=1ff78adb5b51776531eb481207a7290e&amp;mc=true&amp;node=20200929y1.72]]&gt; that, if not completed by Monday, November 30th, could result in your disqualification from future Government subcontract awards and other significant costly disruptions. You should have received a recent communication outlining the steps necessary to avoid such disruption, but if you have not yet completed your actions, please execute the following immediately, but no later than Wednesday, November 25th.




	- Step 1: Complete Assessment: You must have completed at least a Basic Assessment in accordance with NIST SP 800-171 DoD Assessment Methodology &lt;[[https://www.acq.osd.mil/dpap/pdi/cyber/docs/NIST SP 800-171 Assessment Methodology Version 1.2.1 6.24.2020.pdf]]&gt; within the last three years for all applicable covered contractor information systems. A Basic Assessment is a self-assessment. If DCMA has already conducted a Medium or High Assessment for your organization and you have received a score, you have satisfied this step.
	- Step 2: Post Assessment Score: If you completed a Basic Assessment, your summary-level score and other information required by 252.204-7020(d), must be submitted into SPRS &lt;[[https://www.sprs.csd.disa.mil/default.htm]]&gt; or by sending an encrypted email to webptsmh@navy.mil &lt;[[mailto:webptsmh@navy.mil]]&gt; for posting to SPRS. If you have a Medium or High Assessment score, ensure your score is posted to SPRS for all CAGE codes covered by your System Security Plan.
	- Step 3: Tell Honeywell You’re Done with Steps 1 and 2: Please complete the Honeywell Cyber DFARS Questionnaire &lt;[[https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=JuXsln2csEiNr4uTyQpdGLVhGeRHOrxBqz61IZq6O5RUOFoxVUJXSlVIUExCWEFSNkQ2UEFVNTlJNi4u]]&gt; as soon as possible, but no later than November 25th. 



Please also ensure that you are taking similar steps to inform your sub-tier suppliers about these new requirements in order to avoid supply chain disruptions.

Thank you in advance for your cooperation regarding this matter. Please do not hesitate to reach out to your Commodity Manager with SupplierResponsibility@honeywell.com &lt;[[mailto:SupplierResponsibility@honeywell.com]]&gt; on copy with any questions or concerns. 



Sincerely,
