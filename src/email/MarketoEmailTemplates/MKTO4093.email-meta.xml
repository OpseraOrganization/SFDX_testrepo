As a key enabler of FAA NextGen Initiatives aimed at routing aircraft more efficiently and improving safety, Honeywell&apos;s PM-CPDLC offers pilots a number of benefits. According to a 2018 study by Harris Corporation &lt;[[https://www.gwbaa.com/resources/Documents/CPDLC%20Presentation%20April%202019.pdf?mkt_tok=eyJpIjoiWXpoaFlUZzVaVE5tTkRWbSIsInQiOiJ4akJKb3VlZ25ycEw1ZjlWdnNGd3BaXC81Mm95akM2VmFod2pYaU9BYjZGbWFyZXFUVmtLbXhsUXlLc1J2UlRFbElyb1lSVnpneGhWdmN0cVdUb29mMXc9PSJ9]]&gt;, benefits of CPDLC include:



	- 531,000+ minutes of reduced delays thanks to improved re-routing around weather and congestion
	- 641,000+ minutes of communication time saved between controllers and pilots
	- 7M kgs of carbon emissions prevented due to increased flexibility and accommodation of user requests
	- 33,800+ readback errors avoided


Thanks to a tax code change approved in 2018 as part of the Tax Cut and Jobs Act of 2017, U.S. based aircraft owners that use their aircraft for business purposes may be eligible to write off 100% of the upgrade cost in the first year.
