    <textOnly>The Honeywell Global Data Center recognizes that staying on top of new tools and technologies keeps you busy. That&apos;s why we have taken great care while designing the NEW www.mygdc.com &lt;http://www.mygdc.com&gt;. 

 The new site is designed to make the transition from our existing web-site simple and easy. We have taken the already reliable suite of flight planning and following tools and enhanced them with new features based on upcoming regulatory changes and more importantly, your suggestions.

 www.mygdc.com &lt;http://www.mygdc.com&gt; v2.0 features brand-new tools, a streamlined interface, and full compliance with ICAO 2012 flight plan format changes.  Learning to use the new site will take just a few moments (please see the tutorial available from the www.mygdc.com &lt;http://www.mygdc.com&gt; homepage) and we trust you&apos;ll find that it makes your pre-flight planning faster and easier. Please note that the ICAO 2012 mandate is effective November 16, 2012. We encourage you to familiarize yourself with the new website prior to that date.

The entire GDC team is excited to hear your feedback and answer your questions. Please log in, explore, and let us know what you think.

You can reach the GDC 24 hours a day, seven days a week via phone, web, email or datalink message.
