Dear {{lead.Last Name:default=Valued Customer}},




FACT – The ADS-B Mandate is fast approaching!
 By 2020, all aircraft operating in the U.S and Europe will be required to transmit ADS-B positioning information in compliance with DO-260B — the deadline is January 1st for U.S airspace, June 8th for European.
FACT – Time is running out!
 There are literally thousands of non-compliant aircraft requiring upgrade prior to the 2020 deadline. With upgrades taking in excess of 100 man hours per aircraft time is running out.  
FACT – Your operation is a risk if you are not compliant!
 After the 2020 deadline, non-compliant aircraft could be grounded! Even if you’re not grounded operators will be subjected to delays, inefficient routing and higher fuel burn. Are you willing to take the risk?
FACT – The longer you wait – the more it will cost!
 As the 2020 mandates approach the cost of the upgrade will increase as parts and hanger availability declines. If you haven&apos;t budgeted for ADS-B in 2017 make sure you do for 2018!
FACT – Honeywell can help!
 Do you have a crystal-clear plan for securing the required hardware and upgrading your fleet in time to comply with these mandates? If not, Honeywell can help. We are offering a spares exchange (SPEX) option upgrade for Pilatus PC-12NG aircraft currently equipped with KXP 2290 non-ADS-B Transponder. Access to the SPEX exchange pool will facilitate the rapid exchange of your transponder and minimize any aircraft downtime during the upgrade.
