    <subject>Honeywell News: Plan to Close Green Island, New York Site</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear Customer, 

At Honeywell, we continually evaluate our business portfolio to optimize and better serve our customers. After a thorough evaluation, we have decided to close the Green Island, NY facility by September 30, 2021 and plan to move the work to our South Bend site. The Green Island site makes Cerametalix Brake Linings®. The work will transition in phases starting in March 2021. 

View the list of impacted part numbers &lt;[[https://pages3.honeywell.com/rs/641-QIX-912/images/Green Island Part Numbers.xlsx]]&gt;. 

At this time, there are no changes being made to how you engage with Honeywell and your contacts remain the same. Our commitment to customer service does not wane during a transition. Although this plan will not impact you immediately, we would anticipate changes or actions that you will need to complete in the coming months. 

We will certainly keep you updated as any changes or actions become necessary over the next several months. In the meantime, if you have any questions, please reach out to your Honeywell primary point of contact. 

We are working to always give you the quality and the service you deserve. 

Sincerely, 

Honeywell Aerospace
