If it’s a Honeywell Spares part, it’s right here.
Hot off the press. Honeywell Aerospace products used on your aircraft, and services that could benefit your business, all together in one place – the 2016 Honeywell Spare Parts Catalog.
Similar to last year, this year’s on-line catalog is designed to help you quickly find exactly the part you’re looking for. Pricing details are searchable by part number, and are available in a downloadable pdf, or in Excel format so you can upload pricing details into your systems.




 




To get your catalog, just click on MyAerospace portal &lt;http://www.myaerospace.com/&gt;,
 click the ‘Part’ tab, and select the ‘Download pricing catalog’ menu option.
You’ll also want to checkmark the notification option so you can stay informed on price catalog updates throughout the year.

 




Head over to the portal and download your copy of the 2016 Honeywell Spare Parts Catalog. And put the products, services, and support of Honeywell as close as your computer.
We look forward to doing business with you in 2016!
