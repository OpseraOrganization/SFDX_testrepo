    <subject>Master Production Schedule Update</subject>
    <textOnly>April 6, 2020 

Dear Valued Supplier, 

 Honeywell sincerely thanks all suppliers who continue to meet commitments by providing quality parts on-time. Even as we face challenges together during the coronavirus (COVID-19) situation, we should take great pride in being part of critical infrastructure around the world. 

 As you have seen in the news, our shared customers are experiencing dramatic impacts from the COVID-19 situation. For many customers, this has manifested in delays and interruptions in development, demand, production, repair, and delivery of aircraft and other aerospace systems and parts. The decrease in customer demand is beyond Honeywell’s control. For this reason, Honeywell will be adjusting our Master Production Schedule (MPS) beginning the week of April 5, 2020. This change will allow us to better communicate our true demand with you as we realign our supply base capacity from areas where the demand has softened to areas where demand is stable and past due backlog recovery is required.

 We recognize these changes can pose challenges, but we also recognize that many of you are emphasizing the importance of having Honeywell indicate the latest 
and best demand picture so you can prioritize the capacity in your shops. This is an ongoing process, and we will continue to update our production plans based on the material plans we receive to meet the expectations of our shared customers. 

 It is critical that we work together to minimize unnecessary disruptions in the supply chain, and we expect you to promptly acknowledge and accept these purchase order changes. Please work with your respective Honeywell procurement contact with any concerns or questions related to this activity. It’s important that all supplier commitment dates are current and accurate. 

 We understand many of you are working from home, and we wanted to let you know this information as quickly as possible, so you are receiving this letter electronically. If you would like to have us send this to you in hard copy form, we are happy to do so—just let us know.

 Once again, we are all in this together. Thank you for all your support in helping deliver products for our joint-end customers--we couldn’t do it without you.

 Sincerely, 

 Bob Buddecke
