We get it. You love the idea of having in-flight Wi-Fi as good as you’d get at home, but picking the right data plan is intimidating, especially when it’s hard to guess how much data you and your passengers will use. You don’t want to commit to a plan that’s so big you end up leaving gigabytes on the table, but you don’t want to risk the high cost of exceeding your data plan limits. Honeywell has another alternative.


For a limited time, we’re offering our first-ever “pay as you go” plan for Inmarsat Jet ConneX service. With the pay-as-you-go plan, you’ll have no monthly data-use commitment and no restrictions.

If you have been thinking about installing JetWave but the cost of service has been holding you back,  there has never been a better time to get the connectivity you crave. But act now, enrollment in the new pay-as-you-go plan is limited!

Contact StandardAero, a Honeywell Authorized Avionics Dealer, today to get started.
