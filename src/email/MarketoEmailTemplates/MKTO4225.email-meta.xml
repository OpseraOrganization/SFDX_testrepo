Hi {{lead.First Name:default=there}}, 

 For companies in surveying and mapping, generating accurate point clouds is critical when creating mapping systems. Creating them real-time reduces the overhead needed in post-processing and opens new possibilities for the final application. 

 In this study, we identify how customers can easily create accurate point clouds in real-time using our HGuide n580 inertial navigation system (INS/GNSS) in combination with one or more sensors on a computer running the robotic operating system (ROS).
