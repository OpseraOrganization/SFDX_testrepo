EASY ACCESS TO UPDATED PRICING ON MYAEROSPACE
Dear Customer, 

You have received this email because our records indicate that this pricing information is relevant to your job function. If your job function has changed and you no longer need this information, please help us update your information in our database. Click here &lt;[[https://pages3.honeywell.com/Distribution-Update.html]]&gt; to update your information.

To minimize order processing interruptions, please access our catalog 
each quarter for the latest pricing. The MyAerospace Portal &lt;[[http://goaero.honeywell.com/E0G0Q0EVIez0Z0rX2L0hq0p]]&gt; was updated on May 29, 2018 to reflect spares catalog pricing effective July 1. This pricing is effective immediately for 
all quotes or orders with lead times or request dates that result in a shipment on or after July 1.

 Important Points:



	- Not all catalog or non-catalog parts have experienced a price increase.  
	- Honeywell’s pricing policy is based upon the date when the order is shipped.
	- The MyAerospace online ordering &lt;https://myaerospace2.honeywell.com/onlineordering/ordering/OOPriceAvail&gt; application has pricing data for 
both catalog and non-catalog parts.
	- The MyAerospace Portal &lt;[[http://goaero.honeywell.com/E0G0Q0EVIez0Z0rX2L0hq0p]]&gt; is always 
available for your order management needs, including parts quoting, ordering, and tracking. Updates and tutorials are available for your use and reference here &lt;[[https://myaerospace.honeywell.com/contact-us/myaerospace-training]]&gt;. 



Your Actions:


	- 
Orders with shipment dates based on lead times or request dates on or after July 1 need to reflect this pricing update.

	- 
Unless you have contractual pricing with Honeywell, update your vendor pricing systems to reflect the current catalog pricing when issuing purchase orders.

	- 
We encourage you to either:



	- 
Create a customer-specific pricing report &lt;https://myaerospace2.honeywell.com/onlineordering/pricing-reports/DynamicCatalog&gt; from MyAerospace. 

	- 
Use the MyAerospace online ordering &lt;https://myaerospace2.honeywell.com/onlineordering/ordering/OOPriceAvail&gt; application to review the price for your orders.  



	- Download an updated pricing  &lt;https://myaerospace.honeywell.com/parts-and-repairs/downloads/pricing-catalog&gt;catalog &lt;https://myaerospace.honeywell.com/parts-and-repairs/downloads/pricing-catalog&gt; from MyAerospace:


	- The file includes two additional columns:  ‘FUTURE Effective Date’ and ‘FUTURE Price’ columns. 
	- These reflect the price changes effective July 1.




Thank you for your cooperation in updating your systems to reflect current pricing. If you don&apos;t update your systems, you may experience shipment delays because an updated purchase 
order will be required.

If you have any questions, please contact your Honeywell customer support contact or submit a question &lt;[[http://goaero.honeywell.com/o02dZ00UL00pEQ0hzXIGrq0]]&gt; through MyAerospace.
