THANKFUL
From all of us at Team BendixKing, we want to wish all our customers, pilots, families and friends a safe, healthy and wonderful holiday season. Even through this tumultuous year, we can find so much to celebrate and to be thankful for – and we are thankful for you. Stay well and we wish you clear skies ahead!



AN EARLY HOLIDAY GIFTRodrigo Delgado, who lives in Guatemala City, found a love for flying and airplanes as a child, where he would quickly draw any airplane or helicopter he saw. Radio-controlled airplanes gave him a good overview of aviation, and Rodrigo enjoyed his first flight hour in June 1985.  After that, he was hooked on flying and has since owned several Cessna aircraft - his current aircraft is a Cessna C210R.

Rodrigo recently modernized his cockpit with BendixKing avionics and now experiences a new level of flying. Here’s a snapshot of how Rodrigo, through the authorized BendixKing dealer in Guatemala, chose to update his cockpit:

Most importantly, Rodrigo wanted a new high resolution, touchscreen PFD/MFD and the award-winning AeroVue Touch display &lt;[[https://www.bendixking.com/en/products/ifd/integrated-flight-decks/aerovue-touch]]&gt; 
was an easy choice. 

You’ll see in the photos that he also chose an AeroNav &lt;[[https://www.bendixking.com/en/products/nc/navigation-and-communication/aeronav]]&gt; stack so he now has increased safety, enhanced navigation and communication. 

To comply with mandates, Rodrigo also installed the KT 74 ADS-B Out transponder &lt;[[https://www.bendixking.com/en/products/nc/navigation-and-communication/kt-74]]&gt;.



The AeroPanel audio panel &lt;[[https://www.bendixking.com/en/products/audio/audio-panels-accessories/aeropanel]]&gt; let him enjoy high quality audio inside the cabin.

Rodrigo rounded out his upgrade and best utilized panel space by replacing old engine gauges with the AeroPoint 200 &lt;[[https://www.bendixking.com/en/products/ifd/integrated-flight-decks/aeropoint]]&gt; high-resolution engine monitor.



As you can see, BendixKing open 
architecture let him choose options he liked for his cockpit. Thank you, Rodrigo, for choosing to fly with BendixKing.
