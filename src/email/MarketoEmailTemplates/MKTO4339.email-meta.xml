Thank you for your interest in AIN&apos;s webinar, How Business Aviation Can Survive The COVID-19 Pandemic And Thrive Beyond It. 

Honeywell will continue to do what we can to ensure you have the product, support and information you need during this difficult time. For information on how we are responding to COVID-19, please visit the Aerospace FAQ page &lt;[[https://aerospace.honeywell.com/en/pages/aero-covid-19]]&gt;. 

 We thought you might be interested in (and perhaps sharing your own comments and ideas) our newest article, Nine Ways to 
Use Aircraft Downtime &lt;[[https://aerospace.honeywell.com/en/learn/about-us/blogs/2020/04/time-well-spent-aircraft-downtime?utm_source=email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=20_americas_bga_disruption]]&gt;. Downtime doesn’t mean lost time. When flight hours dip below normal, there are still things you can do to tune up your business and keep your aircraft, pilots and maintenance techs practiced and productive. You’ll learn how to:



	- Save money by avoiding aircraft storage pitfalls
	- Keep pilots sharp
	- Make aircraft more productive


You’ll also find links to resources that can help you be ready when flight hours pick up again. 

 Headwinds are part of flying. But use this time on the ground wisely, and you’ll be ready to catch the tailwinds as well.
