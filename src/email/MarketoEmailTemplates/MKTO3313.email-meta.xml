Traveling doesn’t have to mean missing out on life’s little moments or the action from the big game – but only if your BBJ aircraft is powered by JetWave™. 


Honeywell’s premier in-flight connectivity solution hardware, JetWave™, powered by Inmarsat’s fast and reliable Jet ConneX service, is designed to give you the ultimate in-flight entertainment experience. Whether you need to download large attachments, video conference with colleagues or customers, or stay connected with friends and family, JetWave gives you a superior onboard Wi-Fi experience at any altitude.  And when you pair your JetWave system with Honeywell&apos;s state-of-the-art cabin management system (CMS), Ovation Select®, you and passengers will have the ultimate experience 
in connectivity and entertainment. 

Upgrade to JetWave now and save on your Honeywell Maintenance Service Plan, plus write off up to 100% of equipment purchases for business aircraft thanks to 2018 changes to U.S. tax rules.  

Are you ready to upgrade your BBJ with a reliable in-flight Wi-Fi experience that is as good in the sky as you’d get on the ground? Contact Comlux Completion, a Honeywell Authorized Avionics Dealer, to learn more or request a quote today.
