Hello {{lead.First Name:default=Customer}},



We recently asked some of our Chief test pilots to tell us how the FMS 6.1 upgrade makes flying our fleet of aircraft easier, safer and overall my enjoyable. And, what are the benefits pilots want to see out of this upgrade?
Click here &lt;[[https://pages3.honeywell.com/rs/641-QIX-912/images/FMS6.1_Benefits.pdf]]&gt; to see what they said.


Customers who do not upgrade to FMS v6.1 prior to December 31, 2017 will be charged an additional 20% surcharge to their annual navigational database subscription. Honeywell will no longer provide technical support for FMS versions prior to v.6.1 after December 31, 2018, but will continue to support navigational database updates. Customers are encouraged to upgrade their FMS subscription before their next renewal cycle.


To speak to a Honeywell expert and to complete this upgrade, please contact us by filling out your information.
