    <textOnly>Dear GDC Customer,

As a reminder Honeywell Global Data Center will introduce new enhancements to myGDC.com website and iPad app. These enhancements include access to account management features and other online tools for increased online security. 

What does this mean for you?


 - Current users with a GDC ID will be required to create a new Honeywell ID in order to log in to mygdc.com
 - iPad users will need to download the newest version of MyGDC app available April 27th (version 3.4)
 - Migration to Honeywell ID has been rescheduled to begin June 8th and must be complete by June 30th after which time user GDC IDs will no longer be active



The benefits of moving to the new Honeywell ID are:


 - Single Sign On – Login once to the Honeywell Aerospace Portal or pilots.honeywell.com and switch to myGDC.com seamlessly
 - Self-management of credentials – Users will be able to easily change their password, recover a forgotten password, change user information and retrieve a forgotten Honeywell ID all online 
 - Industry standards for strong and secure passwords will enable improved online security



To learn more, please click here &lt;http://www.mygdc.com/NewID&gt; or visit MyGDC.com/NewID.  You can also email us at gfo@mygdc.com &lt;mailto:gfo@mygdc.com&gt; or call us at (888) 634-3330 or (425) 885-8100.

We hope these new enhancements will make your overall experience easier and more secure.

Kind Regards,
