    <textOnly>Special Offer for Cargo Aircraft Operators!

We’ve received several questions from a virtual event we held regarding efforts and initiatives that can be executed now—during aircraft downtime—to improve on-time performance and block and turnaround times upon your return to service. 

Here are three integrated offerings that will help you address challenges by enabling data-based decisions in real time. More importantly, you can get all three solutions listed here now—but not pay for subscription fees in 2020: 



	-  Cockpit Connectivity with Aspire &lt;[[https://aerospace.honeywell.com/en/learn/products/satellite-communications/aspire-400-satellite-communications-system]]&gt;
	- Wireless Transfer with An Aircraft Data Gateway &lt;[[https://aerospace.honeywell.com/en/learn/services/maintenance-and-service-plans/aircraft-data-gateway]]&gt;
	- Data Analytics with Honeywell Forge &lt;[[https://aerospace.honeywell.com/en/learn/connected-aircraft/airlines]]&gt;


We have had strong early interest in these offerings and their synergies, and would like to share some additional details and case studies that highlight the advantages of our combined offering. 

 Let us know if you’d like to take advantage of our 2020 subscription waiver offer. Simply reply to get your airline on the list—it’s a limited-time offer.
