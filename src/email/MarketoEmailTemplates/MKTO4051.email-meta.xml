&quot;My copilot and I have really clear 
and well-defined images on the new DU-875 liquid crystal displays. And with the PEEF (Primus Elite Enhanced Features) upgrade, we get our charts, georeferenced taxiways, and XM Weather.” 

Joey Meier, Pilot for NASCAR Champion Brad Keselowski
Now that the FAA has certified Primus Elite Enhanced Features (PEEF) for the Lear 45,  you may be wondering if it is it worth it to upgrade your cockpit or if you should keep flying it as-is. Or, perhaps you are considering getting a new airplane with the current technology, despite losing substantial equity.

For NASCAR Champion Brad Keselowski, installing Primus Elite was the most economical decision because it upgraded the aircraft to the most current technology and increased his aircraft equity. And, Keselowski&apos;s pilot, Joey Meier, couldn&apos;t be happier with Brad&apos;s investment and the brighter, clearer, high-resolution picture the DU-875 displays provide.
