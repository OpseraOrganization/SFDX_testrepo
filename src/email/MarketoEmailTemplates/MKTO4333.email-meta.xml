    <subject>A Unique Industry Take On Earth Day</subject>
    <textOnly>While businesses and industries like ours always have room to improve, did you know that used aerospace parts have an average of four owners, and that some are installed and performing flawlessly for decades? That is somewhat unique to our industry, and a different take on recycling as the globe honors Earth Day, today. 

 GoDirect Trade is an online marketplace that offers one of the world’s largest selection of used aerospace parts. We sell digitally, and are open 24/7. Every product has a price, photo and real-time availability status. We&apos;ve been featured in Forbes &lt;[[https://www.forbes.com/sites/moorinsights/2020/01/29/honeywell-demonstrates-that-its-an-iiot-not-just-an-ot-company/#3e7c44d768e9]]&gt;, The Wall Street Journal &lt;[[https://www.wsj.com/articles/honeywell-brings-blockchain-to-used-aircraft-parts-market-11559072819]]&gt; 
and Harvard Business Review &lt;[[https://www.tcs.com/content/dam/tcs/pdf/Industries/manufacturing/abstract/HBR-TCS-WP-Nov-2019.pdf]]&gt; and are rapidly moving from “small startup” to “major disruptor.”

As we reflect on Earth Day, and acknowledge the deeply unsettling and humbling effects of the coronavirus 
pandemic affecting all of us personally and professionally, we wanted to remind you that we continue to offer free registration to our online marketplace that can get you started today.
