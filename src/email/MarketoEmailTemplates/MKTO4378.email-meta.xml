    <subject>LASEREF IV Upgrade: Better Performance and Promotional Pricing Available</subject>
    <textOnly>No one knows more about inertial reference systems than Honeywell, the company that pioneered IRS technology more than two decades ago with our signature LASEREF product line. Our latest LASEREF IV system for business aircraft sets new standards for performance and reliability, and it’s now available at a very attractive price. 
 
 For a limited time, Honeywell and Pro Star Aviation are offering attractive promotional pricing and trade-in credit.* For each LASEREF IV ordered, receive a trade-in credit with the return of each LASEREF II and LASEREF III unit.
As of the end of last year, the LASEREF II and LASEREF III are no longer being supported due to obsolescence, so don&apos;t miss this opportunity. You don’t want to be stranded AOG. 
Click below to get in touch with Pro Star Aviation for more information or to request a quote.
*Check special conditions to receive the trade-in credit
