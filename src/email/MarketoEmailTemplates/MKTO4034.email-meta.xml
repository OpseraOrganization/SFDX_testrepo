Honeywell&apos;s Synthetic Vision System (SVS) is an advanced feature available with the Primus Elite upgrade that makes flying into the world’s most challenging airports easier by giving you a view of the terrain, as well as additional information like the runway outline, the breadcrumb trail leading 
to the runway and the plane’s exact flight path. The increased level of situational awareness you’ll experience with SVS will pay dividends when flying to unfamiliar locations, in bad weather, or at night.
