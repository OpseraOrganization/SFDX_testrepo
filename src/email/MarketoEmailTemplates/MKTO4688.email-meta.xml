    <textOnly>OUR NEW CABIN JET CONNEX EXPERIENCE PACKAGES FROM HONEYWELL FORGE HAVE ARRIVED!
Choose a Connectivity Solution That is Right for You 

 Connectivity has never been more embedded in our personal and professional lives like it is today, and business aviation customers are no exception. You need connectivity in the cabin to stay in touch, productive and entertained. But how do you pick a connectivity solution that is right for you? 

 Meet the new Experience Packages &lt;[[https://pages3.honeywell.com/rs/641-QIX-912/images/HoneywellForge_ExperiencePackages_Slick2020.pdf]]&gt; from Honeywell Forge that make picking a cabin connectivity plan easy. 


 &lt;[[https://pages3.honeywell.com/rs/641-QIX-912/images/HoneywellForge_ExperiencePackages_Slick2020.pdf]]&gt;
Chose a plan based on what you need connectivity to do for you, rather than estimating megabytes, hours, uploads and downloads. Our plans are simple, easy and best of all they are custom-built to match your needs.
