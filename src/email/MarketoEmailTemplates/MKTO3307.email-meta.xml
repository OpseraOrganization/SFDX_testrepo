Dear Operator,


There&apos;s no doubt that you&apos;ve heard about the required mandated avionics equipage by the FAA and other aviation regulatory agencies to create the next generation global airborne Communications, Navigation and Surveillance ecosystem. These Mandates are an alphabet soup of requirements -- TCAS Change 7.1, FANS 1/A, PC-CPDLC, PBCS, and ADS-B Out, etc.
 
 Join our webinar Mandates Made Easy - Putting Your Aircraft on the Fast Track to Compliance on Thursday, March 21 at 8:00 a.m. PT / 11:00 a.m. ET.  

You&apos;ll learn what these Mandates mean for you and what you&apos;ll need to upgrade to be compliant. The webinar will be conducted by Honeywell Business Aviation technical experts and will include a Q&amp;A session.
