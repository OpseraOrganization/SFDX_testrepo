This covers more than 2,000 Honeywell part numbers on nearly 100 fixed and rotor wing aircraft platforms, building upon the existing authorizations in place with Duncan Aviation as a licensed Honeywell Authorized Service Center and Channel Partner.

 Duncan Aviation has more than 60 years of experience in the market, with complete Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul (MRO) facilities in
