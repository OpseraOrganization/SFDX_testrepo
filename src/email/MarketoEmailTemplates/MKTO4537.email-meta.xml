New Customer Support Options Coming Soon


 


Our team is working to set up new HGuide support pages which can be accessed from any device. When it launches, you&apos;ll be able to find frequently asked questions and answers supplied by our applications engineering team on topics ranging from accessories to software and more. Need access to HGuide data reader software? We&apos;ll get you access. Need to talk to an engineer directly? We&apos;ll connect you to one. We&apos;ll send you an email once both pages are live and ready to use.
Feedback for Improvement


 


HGuide Highlights are designed to keep our customers in-the-know about what we&apos;re doing to continually drive value to their business. Let us know if there are topics we&apos;re missing or if there&apos;s something we can do to improve this communication.
