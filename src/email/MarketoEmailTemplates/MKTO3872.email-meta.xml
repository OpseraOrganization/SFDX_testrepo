WEBINARTruTrak Integration and Onboarding

Date: September 4th, 2019
 Time: 9 AM MDT
 
TruTrak has long been a leader in low-cost autopilots for experimental and certified aircraft, and now they are part of the BendixKIng family. As valued dealers of TruTrak and BendixKing, we wanted to invite you to a webinar to answer questions and discuss the integration of TruTrak into BendixKing’s product line and how that will affect your business moving forward. 

 Andrew Barker, Vice President of Americas Aftermarket and Experimental Sales, and Lamonte Macon, Channel Manager, will walk you through the BendixKing dealer agreements, how to start buying new products immediately, what the future integration of TruTrak will look like and basic milestone timing. 

 Look forward to talking to you on September 4th!
