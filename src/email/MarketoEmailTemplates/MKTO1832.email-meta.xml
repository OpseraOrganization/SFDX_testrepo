SPEX Option for KXP 2290 ADS-B Upgrade



{{lead.Salutation:default=edit me}} {{lead.Last Name:default=Valued Customer}}



Honeywell is pleased to announce the availability of a spares exchange (SPEX) option upgrade for Pilatus PC-12NG aircraft currently equipped with KXP 2290 non-ADS-B Transponder.



Customers with the KXP 2290 non-ADS-B Transponder now have the option to utilize this SPEX (spares-exchange) program to upgrade to the ADS-B Transponder KXP 2290A. Access to the SPEX exchange pool will incur a fee of $2,000.00 per unit. This access will facilitate the rapid exchange of your transponder and minimise any aircraft downtime during the upgrade.


Please Note: To achieve compliance with the DO-260B mandate, ADS-B functionality must be enabled in the aircraft. Customers are encouraged to contact the aircraft manufacturer or OEM dealer for option pricing. 

To find out more about the SPEX option and the upcoming 2020 ADS-B Mandates, download the flyer below or contact your local Honeywell representative or call 800 601 3099 (Toll Free US &amp; Canada) or 001 602 365 3099 (International Direct).
