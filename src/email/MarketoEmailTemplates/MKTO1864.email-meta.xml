Hello {{lead.First Name:default=Customer}},


Selling your aircraft? Putting off the upgrade because you think you have time?

The FMS 6.1 upgrade is vital to several next-generation upgrades your aircraft will need before Dec. 31, 2019. That’s right – we’re talking ADS-B Out, FANS, PM-CPDLC and others that are right around the corner.

Did you know that several components required for full EASA LPV such as the GPS units are part of your ads-b out upgrade? Adding FMS 6.1 enables WAAS LPV, so why not upgrade while your aircraft is in the shop for ads-b out?

Even if you’re getting ready to sell your aircraft, upgrading to FMS 6.1 is a smart and sound business decision. Don’t leave the next owner with an added cost that may impact their ability to get the information they need to get to their next destination.

Customers who do not upgrade to FMS v6.1 prior to December 31, 2017 will be charged an additional 20% surcharge to their annual navigational database subscription. Honeywell will no longer provide technical support for FMS versions prior to v.6.1 after December 31, 2018, but will continue to support navigational database updates. Customers are encouraged to upgrade their FMS subscription before their next renewal cycle.

Upgrade today with a Honeywell authorized service center and prepare your aircraft for the road ahead.
