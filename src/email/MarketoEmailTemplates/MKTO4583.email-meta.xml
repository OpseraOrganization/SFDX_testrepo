    <textOnly>Hi {{lead.First Name:default=there}},

 Have I mentioned that you can try one of our HGuide IMUs or inertial navigation systems before you buy? 

 We’ve learned that our customers need time to test whether our products will work in their application 
before they buy anything. 

 Let me know if you’re interested in this program so that I can get you one of our products. 

 I look forward to hearing from you. 

Best,
{{lead.hGuide Sales Owner Full Name:default=Hguide Support}}</textOnly>
