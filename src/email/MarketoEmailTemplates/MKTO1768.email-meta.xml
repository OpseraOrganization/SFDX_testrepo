Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Sir/Madam}}:



Finding what you are looking for is easier than ever.



The MyAerospace Portal is your single place to help purchase, track, and maintain your Honeywell products. The MyAerospace Portal makes it easy for you to do business with Honeywell Aerospace. The portal lets you:



- Place and track parts and repair orders

- Download service bulletins

- Find the latest retrofits, modifications and upgrades for your aircraft

- Search our product catalog for more than 100,000 part and systems

- Seek out technical support on your own or open a case



For example, placing parts orders online and viewing the status of both your parts and repair orders is easy. We’ve also streamlined how we communicate with you about your repair orders to keep them moving quickly through the repair process.



On the support side, the Technical Knowledge Center provides customers with the ability to view their own company’s technical issue cases and also to search for answers and videos on a wide range of technical subjects relevant to their equipment.



All this and more is available anytime, from anywhere…so check us out.
