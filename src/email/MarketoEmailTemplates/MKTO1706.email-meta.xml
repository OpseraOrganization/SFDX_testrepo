    <subject>Protection for Aircraft Operators</subject>
    <textOnly>&lt;[[https://aerospace.honeywell.com/]]&gt;

Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Customer}},

We believe aircraft operators deserve protection and peace of mind to focus on serving their customers. To ensure this type of protection, Honeywell Aerospace Trading (HAT) continues to reinforce our support of the B737NG product line with another strategic inventory acquisition.

HAT recently acquired all of the airframe rotable inventory from two more B737NG aircraft. The airframe components will be re-certified and available from the Honeywell Distribution Center outside of London, UK. These are the second and third complete sets of B737NG airframe rotable components purchased by HAT in 2017.

Building upon our past success of providing our customers with a broad range of inventory solutions, in addition to Avionics and APUs, we now support our customers with everything in between including landing gear, thrust reversers, slides, flight controls and more.

HAT is a global provider of serviceable material to aircraft operators world-wide with an international sales force and stocking locations in Europe and North America.

For more information, please contact us by phone at 1-866-TALK-HAT (1-866-825-5428) or by email aerospace.trading@honeywell.com &lt;[[mailto:aerospace.trading@honeywell.com]]&gt;.
