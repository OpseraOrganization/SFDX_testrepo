Honeywell is proud to provide systems that enable the continuing success of the C-130 aircraft. It’s been more than 60 years since the first flight of the first “Hercules” prototype, and since that milestone, Honeywell has helped global C-130 fleet operators maintain operational readiness in even the harshest of environments and combat theaters. From advanced avionics to industry-leading satellite communications systems, Honeywell&apos;s reliable and efficient solutions add value for global operators.
