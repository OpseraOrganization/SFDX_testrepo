    <subject>Updates to the BendixKing Channel Partner Program for 2019</subject>
    <textOnly>&lt;[[http://www.bendixking.com/]]&gt;
Dear valued partner, 
 
  We would like to give you a gentle reminder that it is imperative to sign and submit the new 2019 BendixKing Avionics Dealer Agreement (AvDa) sent to you last month. Your current dealer agreement expires January 31st, 2019 and a valid agreement is required to continue as a BendixKing Channel Partner. Please donâ€™t miss the deadline!  
 
 Discounts for Line Replaceable Units (LRUs) and related product purchases will be changing for 2019. There will now be a different discount level for each of our new tier levels: King Elite, King Select or King Dealer. Your tier will be determined by the amount of your 2018 purchases from BendixKing and will be finalized by the end of this month. Additionally, LRU discounts will be flowed down to assigned distributors in your region where applicable.  
 
 Also in 2019, we will be eliminating the trade-up program. All submittals for outstanding trade-ups must be received by March 31st, 2019. These will be credited upon approval to existing Channel Partners. 
 
 Should you have any questions about the 2019 Channel Partner Program, your 2018 results, tier status, or your BendixKing 2019 AvDa, feel free to contact me at lamonte.macon@honeywell.com &lt;[[mailto:lamonte.macon@honeywell.com]]&gt; or your ASM.  
 
 We appreciate your continued partnership and look forward to a successful 2019. 
 
 Best Regards,
