Dear Valued Supplier,
It is our goal at Honeywell to ensure that the transactions between our companies take place as seamless as possible. We feel that the best way to support this is to provide consistent communication and visibility into any Purchase Orders that we believe to be unacknowledged by our supplier partners. Effective the week of 9/16/19, you will begin to receive a weekly email from AutoSupplierBOT@honeywell.com &lt;[[mailto:AutoSupplierBOT@honeywell.com]]&gt; with a request to acknowledge any outstanding POâ€™s in the Honeywell Aerospace Supplier Portal (HASP) within 3-days of receiving the email. Any purchase orders not acknowledged within the 3-day window will be considered a missing commit in our system.
We value your feedback so if you have any questions regarding this process, you can always reach out to your assigned Honeywell Procurement Focal.
Thank you for your continued partnership.

 Vice President of Procurement &amp; Supplier Management
