    <subject>LASEREF IV Retrofit Program: Better Performance at an Affordable Price</subject>
    <textOnly>&lt;[[https://aerospace.honeywell.com/]]&gt;

No one knows more about inertial reference systems than Honeywell, the company that pioneered IRS technology more than two decades ago with our signature LASEREF product line. Our latest LASEREF IV system for business aircraft sets new standards for performance and reliability and it’s now available at a very attractive price. 

For a limited time, Honeywell and Duncan Aviation are offering attractive promotional pricing and a $52,500 Honeywell trade-in credit for operators who install the LASEREF IV by Dec. 31, 2019. That also is the date Honeywell plans to stop supporting LASEREF II and LASEREF III.

Don&apos;t miss this exciting savings opportunity. Click below to get in touch with Duncan Aviation for more information or to request a quote.
