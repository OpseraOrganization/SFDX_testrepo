WE WANT YOUR FEEDBACK 
 PAUL EBERTZ  | CHIEF PROCUREMENT OFFICER, HONEYWELL AEROSPACE 
 
Dear Supplier, 
 
 We want your perspective on what is working and what requires more improvement. We invite you to participate in this brief survey &lt;[[https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/MWLJB5W]]&gt; to better help us understand the challenges you face as suppliers.  
 
 This survey should take about 6-8 minutes to complete. Your participation is voluntary, and your feedback will be anonymous if you choose to not include your contact information. 
 
 We highly value all ideas, suggestions, and feedback, positive and critical, and we are committed to acting upon your responses to improve our partnership and our products. If you do chose to provide your contact information, Honeywell can better understand how to implement changes.
 
    TAKE THE SURVEY  &lt;[[https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/MWLJB5W]]&gt;    
 With questions regarding this survey, contact Dale Lessard &lt;[[mailto:Dale.Lessard@Honeywell.com]]&gt;, Honeywell Aerospace Global Supplier Development Engineering Leader. 
 
 Thank you for your continued partnership with Honeywell. 
 
 Paul
