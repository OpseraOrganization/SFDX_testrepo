Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Customer}},

Thinking you have a lot of time to schedule your ADS-B Out upgrade and waking up with a grounded aircraft will make you feel like you’re late.
Scheduling your ADS-B Out upgrade today comes with several benefits, including:

• Peace of mind knowing you won’t be like this guy come January 1, 2020.
• The ability to maintain your aircraft value… Yes, it’s dropping every day you don’t have ADS-B installed.
• A lower risk of delaying in your travel plans in 2020… You’re not going to start flying commercial again, are you?

Schedule your ADS-B Out upgrade today and avoid ‘being late to the party.’ Contact Honeywell today to be connected with one our authorized avionics dealers.
