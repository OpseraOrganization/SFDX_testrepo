BendixKing Channel Newsletter | August 2019
An update on your dealership agreement with TruTrak Flight Systems

This newsletter provides an update on the integration of 
TruTrak into BendixKing and your dealer agreement.

 As part of the acquisition of TruTrak, BendixKing has assumed all of TruTrak’s existing dealership agreements. This means that you can continue to purchase, get support and operate as TruTrak dealer, just as you always have.

 Later this year, we will send you a new BendixKing dealer agreement that will take effect in 2020, and replace your current dealer agreement. Depending on what you choose, this new agreement will give you the opportunity to sell all of BendixKing’s non-certified and certified products. For those of you who are not already BendixKing dealers, this will dramatically expand the number of products that you can offer your customers.

 If you don’t want 
to wait until 2020 to begin selling the other BendixKing products, please contact the BendixKing Area Sales Manager &lt;[[https://www.bendixking.com/en/sales-team]]&gt; in your area, and we can roll you over to the BendixKing dealer agreement now.

 No matter which direction you decide to go, 
BendixKing will be happy to provide you the support you need. Once again, we welcome you to the BendixKing family.
