    <subject>Re: Are you waiting for the phone call from the FAA extending the ADS-B deadline?</subject>

Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Customer}},




Waiting for the FAA to extend the ADS-B Out deadline is like waiting for the phone to ring. Only in your case, the FAA isn’t going to extend the deadline and they’re not going to call.

It’s a common myth and one we know to be not true. Every day you wait to schedule your upgrade, the longer you’ll wait on-hold when you decided to pick up the phone and call your avionics repair facility.

Don’t be one of the 6,000 aircraft waiting on-hold come December 31, 2019. That won’t be a fun way to celebrate New Year’s. Make the smart business decision today and let Honeywell help connect you with an avionics dealer near you.
