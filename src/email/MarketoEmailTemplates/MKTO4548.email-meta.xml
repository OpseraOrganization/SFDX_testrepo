    <textOnly>Hi {{lead.First Name:default=there}},

I’ve reached out a few times over the past couple months and haven’t heard back from you.

 Did you find an IMU or inertial navigation system that meets your needs? 

 If so, I’ll make sure to 
take note so that you don’t continue to get emails from me. 

Yes &lt;[[https://pages3.honeywell.com/IMU-Thank-You.html?utm_term=yes]]&gt; or no &lt;[[https://pages3.honeywell.com/IMU-Thank-You.html?utm_term=no]]&gt;

 I look forward to hearing from you. 

Best,
