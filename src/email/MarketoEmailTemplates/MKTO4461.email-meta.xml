    <textOnly>Dear Valued Supplier, 

 Effective the weekend of June 6, a revision to the auto-PO process for VMI FLEX/2.0 was implemented, affecting only VMI orders that have active DPAS flow down. 

Why are we implementing these changes? 

 As part of VMI FLEX/2.0 continuous improvement, we are refining the scope of parts that will significantly reduce the number of POs Honeywell triggers to our VMI FLEX/VMI 2.0 suppliers while reducing the administrative burden suppliers may be experiencing. 

 What do I need to do differently? 

 Please continue to follow the steps below as part of the standard process:



	- Suppliers should maintain a sufficient quantity of parts at or above VMI bin levels
	- Suppliers should create sufficient POs to cover the current Honeywell forecast through the replenishment lead time (typically 14 days)
	- Suppliers should acknowledge the VMI FLEX PO quantity and provide the date the materials are expected to hit the Honeywell dock
	- Suppliers must always review and ensure compliance with flow down requirements in all VMI FLEX POs.
