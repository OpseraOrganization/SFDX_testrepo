    <subject>Greetings from Bob Buddecke, Honeywell Aero ISC CPO</subject>
    <textOnly>As a valued supplier to Honeywell, I would like to personally wish you a very Happy New Year while also introducing myself as the new Chief Procurement Officer (CPO) for Honeywell Aerospace. With over 20 years of experience with Honeywell in a variety of supply chain and general management positions, I know firsthand that our successes are intertwined and can only be achieved through strong collaboration and outstanding performance from each of our organizations. One of my initial goals is to work with our internal stakeholders and suppliers to simplify and optimize our supply chain systems and processes going forward. Doing so will support the ultimate goal, which is to provide world-class quality, delivery, and value to our collective customers. 

 Thank you for all you do for Honeywell. We are honored to have you as our business partner and truly appreciate your continued dedication to delivering quality parts on-time, every time. If you have not yet taken the supplier survey &lt;[[https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/93BZXGT]]&gt; that was recently sent out, I ask you to take the time to do so. Your feedback will help inform additional improvements that I can support in my new role. 

 I look forward to achieving great things together in 2020 as we positively transform our Aerospace Supply Chain together! 

 Sincerely, 

 Bob Buddecke 
Aerospace ISC Chief Procurement Officer</textOnly>
