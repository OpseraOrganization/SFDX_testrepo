Dear Customer:
As part of standard business reviews, Honeywell Aerospace has reviewed our customer accounts and identified that we do not have an MRO agreement with your company. As a result, our systems will automatically adjust your account to Honeywell standard list pricing as of November 27, 2017.  
Up to that date, Honeywell will accept orders for items and quantities in line with your historical purchasing practices and at the discounted pricing you have been receiving for those items. This change does not impact your ability to purchase items from Honeywell, it merely resets your pricing in accordance with our pricing policy. This change does not affect the terms of any written agreement you have with Honeywell.
The MyAerospace Portal &lt;[[https://myaerospace.honeywell.com/]]&gt; is always available for your order management needs, including parts quoting, ordering, and tracking. View MyAerospace updates and tutorials here &lt;[[https://myaerospace.honeywell.com/contact-us/myaerospace-training]]&gt;.
Please access our MyAerospace Portal &lt;[[https://myaerospace.honeywell.com/]]&gt; for additional information or to submit a question &lt;[[https://myaerospace.honeywell.com/contact-us]]&gt; to our Customer Support team.
