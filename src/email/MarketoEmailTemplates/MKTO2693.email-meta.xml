Honeywell’s wireless data LAN management unit (DLMU-W) upgrade by Pro Star Aviation gives Falcon and Gulfstream pilots the ability to load data wirelessly from the convenience of their tablet.

Coupled with Honeywell’s MyHDM and MyMaintainer mobile apps, pilots can load critical flight data at the gate while also unlocking new features, such as:



	- Wireless uploads via simple interface, auto login, status displays – no need for paper updates

	- Email notification when new databases are available

	- Single-button push to load multiple databases to the aircraft

	- Download airplane condition monitoring function data

	- Download and decode fault history database



And, with Pro Star’s mobile response “On-the-Fly” option, they can complete DLMU-W upgrade quickly at your location while you’re in meetings—there’s no need to ground your aircraft for this upgrade.

Improve flight operations and start downloading data more efficiently. Contact us today to speak to an expert at Pro Star Aviation about Honeywell’s DLMU-W upgrade.
