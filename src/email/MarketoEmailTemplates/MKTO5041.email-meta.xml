    <subject>Honeywell Improves Mark Wahlberg’s &apos;21st Century Transporter&apos;</subject>
    <textOnly>Actor and entrepreneur Mark Wahlberg is a man on the go – constantly flying to movie locations, business meetings and charity events all over the world.

 Honeywell flies with him, because Mark just upgraded his personal Global Express with our latest and greatest Primus Elite Advanced Features cockpit and our JetWave satellite communications system, which gives Mark and his passengers in-flight Wi-Fi as good as they get on the ground.
