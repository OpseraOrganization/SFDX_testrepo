Dear {{lead.First Name:default= AirlineColleague}},


Airbus now recognizes Honeywell&apos;s 131-9A Auxiliary Power Unit (APU) as the gold standard to provide significant fuel savings and high core reliability to the A320 fleet. By not having 131-9A APU for your A320 family, {{company.Company Name:default=your airline}} is missing the opportunity of savings thousands of dollars on maintenance and fuel.
Retrofit Payback Offer
Honeywell is offering a limited-time, special pricing and exchange offer on its industry-leading 131-9A APU for Airbus 320 fleet. As part of this offer, retrofit payback can be achieved by:


	- Better fuel efficiency

	- Lower maintenance cost

	- New warranty



No wonder why many global carriers including Air New Zealand, VietAir, Asiana Air have retrofitted 131-9A for 
its:


	- Higher dispatch rate reliability that reduces delays and cancellations

	- Ease of maintenance that reduces on-aircraft maintenance by 36% vs. the competitor

	- Demonstrated engine replacement time of less than 30 mins



 Next steps
Explore 131-9A - a powerhouse of performance &lt;[[https://pages3.honeywell.com/131-9A_APU.html]]&gt; and talk to our sales team for details on the retrofit offer &lt;[[https://pages3.honeywell.com/131-9A_APU.html]]&gt;.
I look forward to talking to you soon.
Best regards, 


Graham Davies
