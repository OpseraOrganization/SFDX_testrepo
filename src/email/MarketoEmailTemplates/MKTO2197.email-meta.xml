    <subject>Position Report Emails - New and Improved - GoDirect Flight Services</subject>
    <textOnly>&lt;[[https://aerospace.honeywell.com/]]&gt;

Dear Customer,



We have improved your emailed position reports and made them easier to read.    


Also we have included the aircraft registration, phase of flight, location and time in the email “subject line” for your convenience. 

The new format includes the following enhancements: 



	- Aircraft status: ‘on ground’ in the title of the position report email: When aircraft is ‘on ground’; the title of the position report email will include “on ground” as aircraft status.

	- Reported time added to the in-flight position report email subject line: when the aircraft is ‘in-flight’; the title of the In-flight position report email subject line will include the reported time.

	- Situational awareness features: departure and arrival time in UTC &amp; local, and fuel on board.

	- Aircraft information: call sign



Note: In the case where a flight plan was not calculated by GoDirect Flight Services and a vendor flight plan was not provided by a customer, ETD and destination will not be included in the position reports.

The enhanced position reports will be available soon. A notification will be sent on the day of release. 



For questions, please contact us at flightservices@honeywell.com &lt;[[mailto:flightservices@honeywell.com]]&gt;.
