To prevent order disruptions, please take the following actions:

	- Effective July 1, 2019: Our new prices will be incorporated in MyAerospace On-Line Ordering and EDI interfaces. Please review the new pricing and apply it to all new purchase orders created on or after July 1, 2019. Also, please update your pricing system with the new pricing information.
