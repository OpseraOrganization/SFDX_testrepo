    <textOnly>&lt;[[https://aerospace.honeywell.com/]]&gt;

Hi {{lead.First Name:default=edit me}},

Did you know that Honeywell’s UAV inspection and data analytics &lt;[[https://aerospace.honeywell.com/uav]]&gt; team recently inspected more than 150 miles of power line inspections in less than five days?

Honeywell is able to work at a faster than our 
competitors as we have long-standing relationships with governing airspace authorities. And, we prioritize safety to ensure every project is done to exceed our customers&apos; expectations.  

“We’re learning what drones can do every day. The Honeywell people are really smart, and it’s fun to challenge them with new ideas and have them come back to us and say they can do it. We look forward to a long future with the Honeywell UAV program.&quot; -Clinton Foster, Right-of-Way Coordinator, Ozarks Electric Cooperative.
