    <subject>Rise of the resistance is now recruiting at GoDirect Trade</subject>
    <textOnly>It is time.

 GoDirect Trade is an online marketplace for aerospace parts. It has been featured in Forbes &lt;[[https://www.forbes.com/sites/moorinsights/2020/01/29/honeywell-demonstrates-that-its-an-iiot-not-just-an-ot-company/#3e7c44d768e9]]&gt;, The Wall Street 
Journal &lt;[[https://www.wsj.com/articles/honeywell-brings-blockchain-to-used-aircraft-parts-market-11559072819]]&gt; and Harvard Business Review &lt;[[https://www.tcs.com/content/dam/tcs/pdf/Industries/manufacturing/abstract/HBR-TCS-WP-Nov-2019.pdf]]&gt; and is rapidly moving from “small startup” to “major disruptor.” 

We launched this marketplace because we listened to customers. Why does anyone need three quotes to purchase a part? Why does anyone put up with emailing to get the price? Why does anyone have to pick up the phone to place an order? 

 GoDirect Trade is bringing efficiency and transparency to this community through blockchain innovation, tech-savvy sellers, and serious elbow grease. There are simply no more excuses for consumers to buy parts “the old way.”
