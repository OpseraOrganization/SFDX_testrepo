Honeywell and its business partner, Western Aircraft, offer the owners of Falcon 900EX/900C and Embraer Legacy 600/650 the opportunity to transform the performance, safety and value of your aircraft with cabin updates. 

Tired of seeing flight information on a 25-year CRT screen? Frustrated by failures and exchange costs? Improve your pilot’s vision and add instant value to your aircraft with the update of the Honeywell DU-875 displays.
Unlike many other screens, the DU-875 LCD display units are designed to fit your existing system, reducing downtime and additional costs. The best part? The DU-875 update doesn’t require additional pilot training or cabin modifications. 
Update your screen today and get some of the latest security features that come with the DU-875* program:


	- 3D terrain, obstacles and runway data

	- Traffic alert and collision avoidance system

	- Meteorological Terminal Aviation Routine Weather Reports (METARs) and Terminal Aerodrome Forecasts (TAFs)


Contact Western Aircraft today for more information and save on your new or existing HAPP plan – Honeywell Avionic Protection Plan.
