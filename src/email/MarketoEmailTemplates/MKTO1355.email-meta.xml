Global In-Flight Connectivity for All Ages


Pilots and passengers will appreciate the affordable, global in-fl ight connectivity provided by AeroWave™ from BendixKing.


Crews will now have in-flight access to global weather services, voice, text, email and their favorite connected aviation apps. Plus passengers will enjoy the ability to send and receive emails, text messages, browse simple web pages, make and receive phone calls and more.


AeroWave’s low-cost connectivity service plan is based on prepaid hours of use – not the amount of data used - so there are no billing surprises. Airtime is only $40 per hour and unlike other services it works at any altitude all over the world.
It’s that simple.

Don’t leave your favorite apps on the ground anymore. Find out how to get globally connected today.
