Are you one of hundreds of Gulfstream, Global Express, Challenger and Falcon aircraft that are operating with obsolete SATCOM equipment?

Constant Aviation, one of the largest and fastest growing MROs in the country, is now 
scheduling upgrades for operators with MCS 3000/6000 SATCOM systems containing obsolete SD-600 Satellite Data Units (SDU). If the SD-600 SDU fails, it cannot be repaired or exchanged, leaving the aircraft unable to operate in FANS 1/A airspace.

Operators can upgrade to the SD-700 SDU or for even more state of the art technology, upgrade to the MCS-7120 system featuring the HD-710 combined Satellite Data Unit and High Power Amplifier. Operators who choose to upgrade their SD-600 SDU with the HD-710 will have access to two channels of Inmarsat Swiftbroadband, allowing passengers to stay connected from the moment they board until they deplane. 

Avoid obsolescence. Contact Constant Aviation today to find out how to upgrade your aging equipment or to request a quote.
