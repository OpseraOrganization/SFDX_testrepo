    <subject>Honeywell is updating catalog pricing on select parts May 15</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear Customer, 

Honeywell will update our Spares, Universal Flat Rate (UFR), and SPEX Exchange catalog pricing on select parts effective May 15, 2021. To view the published part numbers impacted by this pricing update, access the MyAerospace downloadable catalogs after April 30, 2021 and filter on the column ‘Revised List Price’ or ‘Revised Standard Discount Price” as applicable. Parts where pricing is controlled by the Boeing and Airbus product support agreements are excluded from these price adjustments. 

 To prevent order disruptions, please take the following actions:



	- After April 30th 2021, access the updated pricing on Honeywell MyAerospace and downloadable Spares, UFR, &amp; SPEX catalog Files.
	- Effective May 15, 2021, our new prices will be incorporated in MyAerospace Online Ordering and EDI interfaces.


Please review the new pricing and apply it to all new purchase orders created on or after May 15th, 2021. Also please update your pricing system with the new pricing information.

 The MyAerospace Portal is always available for your order management needs, including parts quoting, ordering, and tracking. View MyAerospace Updates and tutorials here &lt;[[https://aerospace.honeywell.com/en/learn/about-us/training/topics]]&gt;. 

 If you have any questions, please contact your Honeywell Business Focal.</textOnly>
