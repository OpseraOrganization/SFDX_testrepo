QUARTERLY HELICOPTER NEWSLETTER
Q4 2017
THE Q4 EDITION
Stabilization Should Lead to Growth in 2018
As anticipated 12 months ago, we are truly seeing stabilization in the commercial helicopter sector. In short summary, commodity prices have rebounded from their lows, the number of used aircraft up for sale has been trending downward for nearly 6 consecutive months, Brent Crude oil prices have experienced positive growth in 2017, and OEM order velocities are stabilizing. 
The above-mentioned points bring not only optimism, but a reality that 2018 will realize positive growth with pent up demand, stabilization in exchange rates are anticipated and overall healthier economic growth is forecasted.
In this edition of the Helicopter Newsletter, you will learn more about:


	- Honeywell’s first dedicated T53 engine service center in the Middle East and Africa, Jordanian Aeronautical Systems Co. (JAC)
	- Our HUMS systems are rapidly becoming smarter and more intuitive for our customers through efforts like the US Army ASTRO Program
	- Helicopter Express highlights how the T53-17 engine’s reliability and capability to operate under high/hot conditions meant continuous heavy lifting capabilities without any performance degradation and increased production
	- An opportunity for you to hear from our experts on how helicopter connectivity can enhance your operational efficiency (Rotor &amp; Wing Webinar Replay)


I wish you a successful close to 2017 and we look forward to meeting with each of you at HAI 2018.

Sincerely, 
Rick Angelo
Director of Strategic Marketing: Global Commercial Helicopters
