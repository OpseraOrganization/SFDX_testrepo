    <subject>Honeywell Has Delivered More Than 500,000 High Performance Inertial Sensors to Customers</subject>
    <textOnly>&lt;[[https://aerospace.honeywell.com/]]&gt;

Hello {{lead.First Name:default=edit me}},


Recently, Honeywell surpassed a significant milestone of delivering more than 500,000 high performance inertial sensors and navigators to customers. 

With decades of experience testing and learning from our customers’ applications, we’ve been able to reach incredible heights in navigation technology.

We’re able to offer that same level of expertise and knowledge to you through our HGuide non-ITAR, MEMS IMUs and navigators &lt;[[https://aerospace.honeywell.com/en/products/navigation-and-sensors/honeywell-hguide-inertial-sensors-and-navigators]]&gt;. 

Experience the difference of working with a small, but mighty inertial sensor and navigation partner.

For a limited time, you can try a Honeywell IMU or navigator before you buy*. Contact us today to learn more.
