<p style="color: #000000; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 16px; font-weight: normal; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;"><img src="https://pages3.honeywell.com/rs/honeywell3/images/SN_3.15Sweeney.jpg" alt="Jim McQueeney" hspace="10" width="125" height="172" align="left" /><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; color: #3e4042;">Dear Valued Supplier,</span></span><br /><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; color: #3e4042;"><br />Have you ever passed a circus and saw elephants calmly standing, chained to a small anchor that sits on the ground? The anchor frequently weighs 30 pounds and you know that full grown elephant could just pick that anchor up and walk off wherever they please. But they don&rsquo;t. They are anchored. This phenomenon occurs because the elephant handlers train the animals when they are young that they cannot lift the anchor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; color: #3e4042;"><strong>How? </strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; color: #3e4042;">When the elephant is a few weeks old, they separate the baby by 50 feet from its mother and chain it to a 500 pound anchor in the ground. Then, they bring the mother in view of the baby who wants to snuggle with its mother but can&rsquo;t. That 500 pound anchor is too heavy for the baby and no matter how hard it pulls and tugs, it cannot leave the anchor. This is done for days until the baby elephant convinces itself that it cannot move and accepts the anchor as immovable. Now, the elephant handlers can pick up and move around a 30 pound anchor from city to city and the elephant accepts the anchor as immovable.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; color: #3e4042;">In Honeywell Aerospace, we have accepted some anchors of the past that need to be seen for what they are &ndash; a self-imposed acceptance of inefficiency and rework that needs to be ripped out of the ground. We need to re-anchor ourselves and challenge the designs for producibility. Over the next few years, suppliers will be asked to identify the features on their parts that are difficult to produce. We are seeking improvements in quality &ndash; <strong>we must pursue zero escapes</strong>, and reductions in lead times and we know we can only achieve that by simplifying your designs. We have already started placing a priority on the high volume, high revenue blocking parts and we will work down the list until we address the 30 percent of the parts that cause 95 percent of the grief. Our re-anchoring is focused on making the designs more producible.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; color: #3e4042;">There is a second major shift going on as well. Historically, Honeywell Aerospace has been &ldquo;Phoenix Centric.&rdquo; The Sourcing and Procurement team has its leaders centered in Phoenix, yet we buy parts from suppliers all over the world. This global supply chain has been managed from Phoenix where time zones, cultures and language have created obstacles due to our &ldquo;Phoenix Centric&rdquo; thinking.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; color: #3e4042;"> We have changed. Currently, we have regional Chief Procurement Officers in our major regions of Asia Pacific and Europe. We also know that we have great people that live in various regions and can source parts across the globe &ndash; regardless of their home base. We need a world view and we are organizing to facilitate the incubation of more new, global and great ideas. We are re-anchoring our organization to reflect a Global perspective supported with Regional leadership.</span></p>

<p style="color: #000000; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 16px; font-weight: normal; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; color: #3e4042;">As&nbsp;we all know, the Aerospace Industry is extremely conservative and very conscious on safety. I&rsquo;m glad that it is because I fly often, as many of us do, and the need for safety is universal and constant. This builds up a paradigm to stick with the processes that we know and we have evolved into an industry full of lethargic behaviors. We are arrogant, we are set in our ways, and we believe our way is the only way and that anything new is a problem. <strong>While I want us to be intelligent and cautious</strong>, I also want us to be smart and open our eyes to look at the world around us.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; color: #3e4042;">In the 1970s the American Car makers owned the world. They were arrogant, they were set in their ways and it took the Oil Embargo of the mid 70s to open eyes. You all know the story, Toyota and Honda came in, the market liked their cars and the revolution to lean manufacturing took off. The Big Three market share eroded to new depths and the financial crisis of 2008 was the final straw to allow them to hit bottom.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; color: #3e4042;">Now look at the car makers &ndash; all of them &ndash; US and International. These products keep getting safer. New airbags, better structures, navigation systems, back up vision systems, the new cars have all kinds of added features to benefit the consumer and the price of the cars remain relatively stable. How is that? More features, consistent price &ndash; they must be losing margins, right? But look at the profitability &ndash; GM Ford and Chrysler are making money.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; color: #3e4042;">How can they give more value, at the same price and make more money all at the same time? It&rsquo;s simple. They are open to intelligent change, continuous improvement and the elimination of waste.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; color: #3e4042;">We have to do the same.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; color: #3e4042;">Right now Honeywell is driving and seeking producibility with all of our parts and our suppliers. We are looking for the features in our legacy designs that don&rsquo;t make sense. There are features that are hard for you to produce, they cause quality and delivery delays and they cost more money. We are asking you to help identify these features through your Honeywell Suppler Development Engineers, the Buyers and the Field Quality Engineers. Please let them know and ask them to submit a Supplier Engineering Request. Sure, we will be looking to share in the cost saving in order to get payback for our re-designs, but there is big savings in it for you as well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; color: #3e4042;"> When we embrace intelligent change and remain resolved on Continuous Improvement and the elimination of waste, there is no telling how much we can improve.</span></p>

As a quick reminder, this project will incorporate Honeywell User Experience (HUE) factors into the Supply Chain Collaboration (SCC)/Honeywell Aerospace Supplier Portal (HASP) including a redesigned PO Summary screen, easier to use Mass Acknowledgement functionality and expansion of the Acknowledgement with Change functionality. There will also be enhancements to the Planning Schedules and Horizon Reports and newly designed Supplier Dashboard. We are targeting Q4 for implementation, so please stay tuned!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; color: #3e4042;">On June 1, HASP, a part of Honeywell&rsquo;s Supply Chain Collaboration portal, SCC expanded to include additional Honeywell&rsquo;s business units. With this expansion, updates have been made to improve user&rsquo;s experience within the portal. Here is a summary of the changes:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; color: #3e4042;">Double scrolls within the portal have been removed</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; color: #3e4042;">Updated login screen</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; color: #3e4042;">Ability to use the full screen, which will hide the menu list</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; color: #3e4042;">Better utilization of screen space by removing the white space edges</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; color: #3e4042;">Optimization of user&rsquo;s monitor size</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; color: #3e4042;">Upgraded hardware to improve response times by 25-30 percent</span></li>

<p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 18px; color: #3e4042;">The USD and Global Currency Wars</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; color: #3e4042;">Through mid-March of this year, the U.S. dollar had enjoyed its fastest rise (i.e. strengthening vs. other currencies) in 40 years as it rose considerably since July, 2015, and strengthened dramatically against all the world's other major currencies, according to Citibank. One way to measure the U.S. dollar&rsquo;s historic move is through the &ldquo;U.S. Dollar Index&rdquo;.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; color: #3e4042;"><u>U.S. Dollar Index</u>: The U.S. Dollar Index, as defined by investopedia.com, is a measure of the value of the U.S. dollar relative to majority of its most significant trading partners. The index factors the exchange rates of the Euro, Japanese Yen, British Pound, Canadian Dollar, Swedish Krona, as well as the Swiss Franc; and started with a base of 100 established in 1973. Since the U.S. has different levels of trade with each country, their respective currencies are weighted as follows:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; color: #3e4042;">Euro&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 57.6%</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; color: #3e4042;">Yen&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 13.6%</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; color: #3e4042;">Pound&nbsp; 11.9%</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; color: #3e4042;">Dollar&nbsp;&nbsp;  9.1%</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; color: #3e4042;">Krona&nbsp;  4.2%</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; color: #3e4042;">Franc&nbsp;&nbsp;  3.6%</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; color: #3e4042;">Despite the recent downturn, the U.S. dollar has strengthened 21.2 percent over the past 12 months against this basket of six currencies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; color: #3e4042;">Another way of viewing the U.S. dollar is to compare it to only one other currency. In this respect, and as of the end of May, on a weekly average basis the U.S. dollar had gained 24.3 percent against the Euro, 20.2 percent against the Japanese Yen and 14.2 percent against the British Pound over the past year. One U.S. dollar is worth more foreign currency units than a year ago.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; color: #3e4042;">Earlier in the year the U.S. dollar hit a 12 year high versus the Euro while just recently hitting a 12 and a half year high versus the Yen.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; color: #3e4042;"><u>Dollar Drivers</u>: Quantitative easing (QE), and other economic stimulus programs implemented by the various global governments, are largely credited for the weakening their respective currencies &ndash; termed &ldquo;Currency Wars&rdquo; in financial circles. These countries benefit from their weaker domestic currency as it effectively discounts the price of their goods and services, which drives demand and contributing to the growth of their economy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; color: #3e4042;">Back in January of this year, the European Central Bank committed to a QE program worth approx. 1.1 trillion Euros ($1.3 trillion) to counter the threat of an economic recession and deflation. In December, 2012, Japan implemented a massive government stimulus program that included monetary easing (i.e. the driver that weakens the local currency) in response to decades of deflation and economic malaise, according to the Council on Foreign Relations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; color: #3e4042;"><u>U.S. Relative Buying Power</u>: U.S. companies including Aerospace benefit from a stronger U.S. dollar as it places foreign goods, services and even companies &ldquo;On Sale&rdquo;.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; color: #3e4042;">The Wall Street Journal reports that the U.S. dollar moves make it cheaper for U.S. companies to buy foreign ones, and is among several factors amid an overall mergers and acquisitions boom. They cite, &ldquo;U.S. companies committed $250 billion to overseas acquisitions last year, the most on record, according to FactSet data going back to 1995. That is a 136 percent rise from 2013, far outpacing the overall increase of about 66 percent in global merger activity. So far, 2015 is on pace to log more than $350 billion in U.S. outbound deals.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; color: #3e4042;">Delivery company FedEx Corp. cited the stronger dollar in its pending $4.8 billion takeover of Dutch carrier TNT Express NV, announced April 7. &ldquo;This deal would have cost us 20 percent more in dollar terms had we done it a year or so ago,&rdquo; XPO&rsquo;s chief executive, Bradley Jacobs, said in a conference call announcing the transaction.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; color: #3e4042;">The U.S. dollar certainly is buying more today that it has been able to in many years.</span></p></div>
