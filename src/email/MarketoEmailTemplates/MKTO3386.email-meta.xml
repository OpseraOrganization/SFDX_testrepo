    <subject>Make Your Cockpit &quot;Cool&quot; Again with Primus Elite!</subject>
    <textOnly>&lt;[[https://aerospace.honeywell.com/]]&gt; &lt;[[https://www.duncanaviation.aero/]]&gt;

Your Primus 1000 / 2000 cockpit was the greatest back in the day, but now those days are past. Are you done with those tired, old CRT displays – with their poor color, weak contrast, annoying flicker -- and the way they overheat your cockpit? Those screens are obsolete and no longer serviceable. Now there’s a way to make your 
cockpit “cool” again! The Primus Elite DU-875 liquid crystal display upgrade delivers brighter, clearer, higher resolution images, and 2X the reliability of your old, obsolete DU-870 CRTs. The upgrade is an easy “plug and play” replacement that can be done in less than a day.Upgrade before 6/30/2019 and save up to $210,000* thanks to a $35,000 
trade in credit for each DU-870 unit you replace. Contact Duncan Aviation to learn more or request a quote. 





UPGRADE NOW &lt;[[https://pages3.honeywell.com/Duncan_Primus_Elite_201903.html]]&gt;







*Savings of up to $210,000 is based on upgrading all six (6) displays on a Global Express. Please contact Duncan Aviation to ask about savings for your aircraft model.</textOnly>
