    <subject>Connecting the Most Overlooked Part of Aerospace: The Ground!</subject>
    <textOnly>GoDirect Ground solutions can cut delays by up to 30 percent.

Honeywell expanded its Connected Aircraft services to one of the last unconnected aerospace frontiers, the ground. The GoDirect Ground &lt;[[https://aerospace.honeywell.com/en/services/aerospace-services/godirect-ground-handling-service]]&gt; solutions can connect an airportâ€™s ramp service into one single, managed solution that provides airlines and ground handlers with real-time insights into vehicle activity anywhere at the airport. 

The result? Better on-time performance, lower maintenance costs and greater fuel efficiency!
