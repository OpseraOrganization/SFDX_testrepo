    <textOnly>Hi {{lead.First Name:default=there}}, 

Recently, one of my team members tried to reach you to talk to you about our Laseref IV upgrade and told me you mentioned that price was an issue. 

 Aside from our current trade-in promotion, did you know that by upgrading to Laseref IV, you can actually lower your cost of ownership? 

 This Laseref IV is lighter, more reliable, offers standard communication bus digital outputs and improved maintenance, which provides the lowest cost of ownership for inertial reference systems 

 I’d love to chat with 
you more about why many of our customers have made the switch already. 

 Is there a day/time that works best for you for us to connect? 

 I look forward to hearing from you. 

 Sincerely, 

 Kathy Tyler</textOnly>
