Today, many utility companies use walking crews or helicopters to inspect their distribution lines or solar farms. This can be time consuming, expensive and dangerous if staff are required to inspect poles or lines in rugged areas. 

Honeywell’s UAV inspection service and data analytics &lt;[[https://aerospace.honeywell.com/uav]]&gt; provides a cost-effective and safe solution to utility companies 
and requires less time than using a walking crew or helicopter company.

And because our services are more cost-effective, utility companies are able to conduct periodic inspections, allowing them to proactively inspect their properties. Plus, once we’re finished, we don’t leave you with thousands of images to review. 

Our proprietary data analytics software uses machine-learning algorithms and artificial intelligence to scan thousands of images to detect cracks, pole rot, vegetation encroachment and more. 

Improve safety and save money with Honeywell’s UAV inspection services. For more information or to speak to one of our regional UAV inspection experts, please contact us below.
