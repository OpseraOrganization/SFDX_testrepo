    <subject>Re: Fly Commercial or Upgrade to ADS-B Out? You decide.</subject>

Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Customer}},


Long and slow-moving lines, busy baggage claims, delayed flights and cramped commercial airline seats await operators who wait to schedule their ADS-B Out upgrade.

According to our experts, 6,000 aircraft still need to complete the ADS-B Out upgrade by December 31, 2019. Of those aircraft, more than 3,000 have a Honeywell-equipped cockpit flying today and this number includes your aircraft.

If every aircraft mentioned scheduled their upgrade today, more than 140 aircraft would need to complete the upgrade every day from now until the deadline – and that’s not happening right now.

At Honeywell, we’ve seen an increase in the number of installations in 2017 compared to 2016 and are urging you to schedule your upgrade while there’s still room. Let Honeywell help you by connecting you to one of our authorized avionics dealers today before it’s too late.

Don’t ground your aircraft and pay the increased costs of waiting in line for your ADS-B Out upgrade.
