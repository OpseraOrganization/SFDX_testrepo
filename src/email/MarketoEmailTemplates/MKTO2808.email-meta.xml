    <subject>Upgrade Your Cabin Management System Touchscreen Now to Avoid AOG</subject>
    <textOnly>&lt;[[https://aerospace.honeywell.com/]]&gt;

Dear Customer:
 
Beginning January 1, 2019, Honeywell will no longer have the capability to repair obsolete MHT 10.4” touchscreens and related components, which control your Honeywell Ovation Select C-Series cabin management system (CMS).

To help solve your obsolescence, a full cabin upgrade is not required. A phased upgrade approach is an available option based on your budgetary needs and convenience. This enables you to extend the life of your aircraft and improve your passenger experience, while avoiding downtime or groundings.

We recommend reviewing various upgrade options with your preferred Honeywell dealer and inquire about scheduling an install.


Please click here &lt;[[https://pages3.honeywell.com/rs/641-QIX-912/images/SERVICE_INFORMATION_LETTER_080818.pdf]]&gt; for the MHT Service Information Letter (SIL). The link lists two SIL’s, each includes two different sets of affected part numbers as listed below.
