    <textOnly>Hi {{lead.First Name:default=there}},

 I hope your week is going well. 

 Honeywell recently published an article for AW139 operators, and I thought this would be an interesting read for you. It highlights a few of our latest cockpit technologies and services that focus on safety and performance specifically for AW139 operators. Please see the link to the article below.

 Please feel free to reach out if you have any questions. 

 Thanks,
