Time is Running Out! Schedule Your ADS-B Out Upgrade Today.

Estimates indicate that up to 25% of eligible aircraft will fail to get their FAA-mandated ADS-B upgrades by the January 1, 2020 deadline, forcing them out of Class A, B and C airspace. Honeywell Aerospace is working closely with Duncan Aviation to help customers reach ADS-B Out compliance by installing the Primus II Radio System. Duncan Aviation still has capacity at satellite locations in:



• Atlanta
• Boston
• Cincinnati


•  Kansas City
• Las Vegas
• Seattle


• Scottsdale
• St. Louis
• St. Paul


• Teterboro
• Van Nuys






Don’t delay your ADS-B out upgrade any longer and risk dealing with scheduling conflicts, paying higher prices or delayed travel plans! Contact Duncan Aviation today to request a quote and schedule your upgrade.
