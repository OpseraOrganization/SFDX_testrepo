Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Customer}},


We attempted to reach out to you a couple weeks ago and still have not heard from you. Are you still in the process of completing the FMS 6.1 upgrade?

Honeywell’s FMS 6.1 software supports several next-generation upgrades such as WAAS-LPV, FANS, RNP enhancements and much more. FMS 6.1 aligns with the requirements of the upcoming mandates, enables access to more airports and provides a safer overall flying experience for everyone onboard.
Customers who do not upgrade to FMS v6.1 prior to December 31, 2017 will be charged an additional 20% surcharge to their annual navigational database subscription. Honeywell will no longer provide technical support for FMS versions prior to v.6.1 after December 31, 2018, but will continue to support navigational database updates. Customers are encouraged to upgrade their FMS subscription before their next renewal cycle.

Schedule your upgrade today or let us know when you’ve scheduled your upgrade so that we can update our records.
