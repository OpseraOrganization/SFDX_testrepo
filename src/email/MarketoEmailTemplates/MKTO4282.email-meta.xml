    <subject>First Article Approval and Source Inspection amid COVID-19</subject>
    <textOnly>March 31, 2020 

 Dear Valued Supplier, 

 Due to the recent coronavirus situation, we are faced with new challenges which require partnership to satisfy our mutual end customers’ needs. 

 Honeywell expects that Source Inspection &amp; FAIR review be treated as ‘business critical’ visits. Please coordinate whatever internal approvals are required for these visits and communicate any pre-screening protocols to Honeywell visitors. Honeywell procurement may request copies of visitor policies for the purpose of minimizing disruption to product flow. 

 Where Government or Corporate policy prohibits travel to or entry of a visitor attempting to perform Source Inspection or FAIR review on products due to ship, the supplier will be provided with instructions on suitable alternatives for the visit which may include streaming video of part over inspection, uploading of pertinent documents, and/or shipment to an outside inspection source or to a Honeywell site in advance of FAIR or Source approval. 

 As with all Source Inspections and FAIR reviews, submittal of nonconforming product will result in rejection regardless of the manner of submittal. 

 Sincerely, 

 Norm Weiberg 
 Vice President, Quality/HOS
