Do you have a 2020 Vision?

Dear {{lead.Last Name:default=Valued Customer}}, 



By 2020, all aircraft operating in Europe and the U.S will be required to transmit ADS-B positioning information in compliance with DO-260B transponder standards - the deadline is 01 January 2020 for U.S airspace* and 07 June 2020 for European 
airspace*.
 
 Do you have a crystal-clear plan for ensuring your Citation Sovereign aircraft is upgraded in time to comply with these mandates? If not, Honeywell can help. We have announced a special program to reduce downtime required for the mandated ADS-B upgrades for the Textron Citation Sovereign aircraft currently equipped with Primus Epic Radio Suites. This program offers an OEM certified upgrade to the configuration and maintains the system integrity as originally certified. Effective immediately, Honeywell will provide special exchange pricing per shipset through Textron Aviation. Click below for more information and let Honeywell help you develop your 2020 vision.
