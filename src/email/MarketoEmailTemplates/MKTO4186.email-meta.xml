    <textOnly>Greetings, {{lead.First Name:default=}} 

 I’m thrilled to invite you to the 2020 Honeywell Customer Advisory Board meeting here in Phoenix March 10, 2020. Since our last board meeting, our team has been hard at work designing, developing and releasing software, applications and hardware based on your feedback. We are now turning our focus to the next generation of cabin connectivity and believe your experience and input will help us shape and prioritize these solutions. 

 We have revised roadmaps and demonstrations we are excited to share with you along with a first look at new technology you helped develop. We will have a packed agenda again and hope you can make the meeting. 

 Where:


Honeywell – Phoenix Sky Harbor
1944 E. Sky Harbor Circle
Phoenix, Arizona 85034

 When:



	- Monday, June 10 – Welcome Cocktail Reception
	- Tuesday, June 11 – Meeting and Dinner



 Please RSVP by Friday, February 19 so we can make appropriate hotel arrangements. We would also like to send you a formal invitation with agenda topics. 

 We look forward to seeing you in March.
