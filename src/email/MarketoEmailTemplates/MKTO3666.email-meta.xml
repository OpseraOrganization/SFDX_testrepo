Special Pricing Discounts for TFE731-4/-5 Rotor Replacement 


We all know the ADS-B out deadline is approaching quickly, but with all the attention on that mandate, have you forgotten about the FAA’s Airworthiness Directive for TFE731 engines? 
 
Released in 2012, this FAA Airworthiness Directive requires TFE731-4/-5 operators to replace affected LPT1 rotor assemblies in order to prevent uncontained disk separation, engine failure and 
damage to the aircraft. The replacement must be done by August 2020. 
 
Avoid parts shortages and maintenance delays! Schedule your maintenance by August 30, 2019 and take advantage of special pricing discounts on your replacement turbine rotor.  Contact Dallas Airmotive at (214) 304-2726 &lt;tel:2143042726&gt; or online by clicking below!
