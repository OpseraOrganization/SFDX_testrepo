Dear Honeywell Customer:
 
We value your feedback and have used it to make doing business with us easier. Our Honeywell Aerospace team is always looking for faster and better ways to ensure you stay flying.   
 
Based on the recent feedback we received from past surveys, we’ve taken action to:


	- Increase the number of field service engineers and technical personnel visits and armed them with the latest technology to solve technical problems quickly and efficiently. &lt;[[https://myaerospace.honeywell.com/]]&gt;
	- Enhanced the Direct Access mobile application &lt;[[https://aerospace.honeywell.com/en/services/aerospace-services/direct-access]]&gt; to make it easy to connect with technical and pilot support as well as AOG services. 
	- Improved digital ordering and the technical support experience through the MyAerospace Portal &lt;[[https://myaerospace.honeywell.com/]]&gt;.


If you receive an industry survey like the Professional Pilot Avionics survey, we hope you will fill it out and let us know how we are doing. We appreciate your feedback and will continue to drive the right improvements to make doing business with Honeywell easy.
