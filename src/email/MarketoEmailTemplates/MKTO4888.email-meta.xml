    <subject>New Cabin Experience Plans Have Arrived!</subject>
    <textOnly>OUR NEW CABIN EXPERIENCE PACKAGES FROM HONEYWELL FORGE HAVE ARRIVED!
Choose a Connectivity Solution That is Right for You 

 Connectivity is integral to our personal and professional lives like never before. When you fly in a business jet, you need to stay connected, productive and entertained, anywhere you travel. But how do you pick a connectivity solution that is right for you?

 Meet the new Experience Packages from Honeywell Forge &lt;[[https://www.aerospace.honeywell.com/en/learn/connected-aircraft/business-aviation/airtime-services]]&gt;. They make picking a cabin connectivity plan easy. 


 What do you need to do when you fly? Choose your Experience Plan based on your needs, rather than estimating megabytes, hours, uploads and downloads. Our plans are simple, easy and – best of all – tailored to match your needs. 

 Contact your Honeywell sales representative or call: 1-888-634-3330 Ext 7 or email sales.honeywellforge@honeywell.com &lt;[[mailto:sales.honeywellforge@honeywell.com]]&gt; to try our new packages today.
