    <subject>Streamlining the Engine and APU Rental Process</subject>
    <textOnly>&lt;[[https://aerospace.honeywell.com/]]&gt;

We’re making it easier for you to rent engines and APUs from us.  From now on, not only will you just complete one form, but we’ll also support digital signatures instead of paper signatures.  
 
This streamlined and simplified process will significantly shorten the time for an operator to start flying again and minimize confusion.
 
Follow these easy steps:


	- Complete the new rental worksheet &lt;[[https://pages3.honeywell.com/rs/641-QIX-912/images/BGA Rental Step 1 - Channel Partner Fill Out Rental Worksheet %26 Send to ....xlsx]]&gt;.
	- Email the form and purchase order to enginerentals@honeywell.com &lt;[[mailto:enginerentals@honeywell.com]]&gt;.
	- Honeywell completes the bailment and sends the form through DocuSign to you and to the customer for e-signatures simultaneously.
	- After the signed bailment is received, the engine or APU is shipped. 


Alternatively, if you wish to continue completing the bailment agreement, we’ve also made that easier with auto-fill pricing and check boxes.  


Access the new forms on the website here &lt;[[https://aerospace.honeywell.com/en/services/aerospace-services/engine-rental-bank]]&gt;, or download the rental worksheet here  &lt;[[https://pages3.honeywell.com/rs/641-QIX-912/images/BGA Rental Step 1 - Channel Partner Fill Out Rental Worksheet %26 Send to ....xlsx]]&gt;and the simpler bailment agreement form here &lt;[[https://pages3.honeywell.com/rs/641-QIX-912/images/BGA Rental Step 2 - Rental Bank Fills out BGA APU Bailment Agreement 201....xlsx]]&gt;.
