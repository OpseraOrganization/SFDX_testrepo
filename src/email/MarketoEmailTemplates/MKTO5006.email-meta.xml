Safety and efficiency are essential in today&apos;s aviation industry. At Honeywell, we continuously develop solutions that make flights safer for the crew and passengers and more cost effective for operators. An excellent example is the latest addition to our family of inertial reference systems – LASEREF IV. 

 LASEREF IV replaces the aging LASEREF II and III, which became obsolete in 2019 and are no longer supported by Honeywell. Suitable for a wide range of business aviation aircraft, LASEREF IV reduces installation and operating costs, as well as pilot and crew workload. Plus, it offers a 30% improvement in reliability compared to its previous versions. 

 To promote this retrofit, we are partnering with Pentastar Aviation to offer special trade-in pricing and availability throughout 2021.

 Contact Pentastar Aviation to find out more on how to upgrade to LASEREF IV and advance your aircraft’s capabilities.
