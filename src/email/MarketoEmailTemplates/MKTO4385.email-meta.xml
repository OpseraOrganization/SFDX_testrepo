    <textOnly>Dear Valued Customer,

 The 2020 AIN (Aviation International News) Product Support Survey is now live. This in-depth annual survey asks readers to evaluate aircraft, engines and avionics products they have had experience with during the prior 12 months. Readers are invited to evaluate aircraft and engines across 10 different categories and avionics across seven different categories. 

 At Honeywell, we view the AIN Survey as an important benchmark for improving our products and services. Your participation &lt;[[https://www.ainonline.com/aviation-international-news-subscribe?ain_promo_code=honeywell]]&gt; before June 12, 2020 will be highly appreciated. The results and feedback gained through the survey will help us monitor our strengths and successes and, more importantly, identify areas for continued improvement and investment. 

You Asked – We Answered &lt;[[https://aerospace.honeywell.com/en/pages/when-you-fly-we-fly]]&gt;

 When completing the 2020 AIN Survey, please consider some of steps we’ve taken, based on your feedback to make it easier to work with Honeywell in the last 12 months.

 We have also taken appropriate actions to assist our loyal customers during these uncertain and unprecedented times. To provide some relief to your operations, Honeywell is taking the following actions effective now through June 30, 2020 for our MSP (Maintenance Service Plan) customers:


	- Minimum flight hours for Engines and APUs reduced by 50%
	- Extended time for returns: Rental Engines/APUs (+7 days), SPEX cores (+14 days)


Once again, I would like to take the opportunity to thank you for your business. Your feedback to the AIN Survey will be taken seriously and our team will use the feedback and comments to identify key challenges that we need to address. Our aim is to get wider local feedback from our region to implement solutions needed to serve you better locally.

 Sincerely,


 Matt Spence
