A Special Offer for You from Flightstar


Have you put off your ADS-B out installation? Don’t be grounded in 2020 with the help of Flightstar, a Honeywell Authorized Avionics Dealer. 

For a limited time, Flightstar will waive the STC cost on your ADS-B out upgrade (a $7,000 value) when you upgrade two or more of your obsolete DU-870 displays to DU-875. In addition, Honeywell is offering exciting incentives to Lear 45 customers, including a $35,000 trade-in credit per DU-870 display unit and additional savings opportunities on your Honeywell Maintenance Service Plan for Avionics (formally known as HAPP). 

Flightstar only has the capacity for 3 more ADS-B upgrades this year so space is very limited. Don’t delay your ADS-B upgrade and risk sitting on the ground in 2020. 

Contact Flightstar today to discuss your upgrade options and request a quote.
