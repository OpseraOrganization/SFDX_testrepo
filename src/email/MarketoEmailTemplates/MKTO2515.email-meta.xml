Get 2020 Vision on Your Air Traffic Mandate!  
By 2020, all aircraft operating in Europe and the U.S. will be required to transmit ADS-B positioning information in compliance with DO-260B transponder standards - the deadline is January 2020 for U.S. airspace* and June 2020 for European airspace.* 
Do you have a crystal-clear plan for securing the required hardware and upgrading your Bombardier aircraft on time to comply with these mandates? If not, ExecuJet Malaysia and Honeywell can support with a variety of ADS-B compliant solutions which are available now! Although the mandate deadline is still over two years away, ExecuJet Malaysia and Honeywell recommend that you act now! Product availability and service center capacity will become increasingly scarce as we approach the FAA and EASA deadlines. Upgrading sooner not only ensures aircraft readiness, but also provides you with benefits such as more direct routings, more efficient route changes and fuel savings.
