YOU ARE INVITED!
Dear Customers,

It’s going to be an exciting Oshkosh this year at the BendixKing Pavilion. We’ll be celebrating our 60th Anniversary, alongside EAA’s 50th Anniversary for AirVenture event July 22 – July 28. From new products and services to complete integrated flight decks, we’ll have on display everything you’ll need to upgrade your experimental and certified aircraft.

Register here for our Annual Customer Appreciation Event where you can enjoy food and beverages with our team members and celebrate our 60th Anniversary, while learning about our experimental and certified aircraft solutions. Register today, as our popular event is space-limited.
