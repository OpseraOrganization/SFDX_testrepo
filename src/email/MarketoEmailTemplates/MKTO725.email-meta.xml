Here to ensure a happy landing at Sochi this Winter

Honeywell Aerospace will be available throughout February to support operators and customers flying to Sochi. With resources located strategically across the region we have the right team in place to help you overcome any technical or service issues, including in-country Field Service Engineers and Customer and Product Support.

In addition, Honeywell will have mechanical and avionics systems spares available to manage any potential issues that may arise. Operators can also expect additional shift coverage from our Technical Operations Center to assist with Aircraft on Ground (AOG) situations.
