    <subject>Form, Fit and Function: F-16 Upgrades with Aero Precision</subject>
    <textOnly>Next Generation F-16 Technology with Honeywell and Aero Precision
As a leading cockpit display supplier for the F-16 aircraft, Honeywell introduced the LED backlight in the F-16 Common Color Multi-Function Display in 2009. Since that time, all newly purchased CCMFDs feature the LED backlight.
Honeywell can now offer the LED Backlight as an upgrade to replace the current fluorescent backlight in the existing CCMFDs. Honeywell’s CCMFD LED backlight is an “environmentally-friendly” display solution that eliminates the fluorescent bulb for improved operation, higher reliability and resolution of obsolescence issues. Providing superior optical performance, the LED Backlight also provides increased backlight luminance in NVIS mode to address a reported operational problem.
Plus, with Aero Precision, you can expect efficiency and effectiveness on your order. As a leading provider for the F-16, Aero Precision prides itself in being flexible, reliable and committed to quality. 
Click on the link below to request more information about this upgrade or call Aero Precision at (925) 380-2384 &lt;tel:(925) 380-2384&gt; to speak with a dedicated representative. You can also meet us at the F-16 TCG from September 9th to 10th at booths 130,131 and 132.
