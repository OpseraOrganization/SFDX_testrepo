WEBINAR
 Your Second in Command: BendixKing’s AeroCruze Autopilots
Date:Thursday, October 17, 2019 – 4pm ET

Used effectively, an autopilot can be the single greatest safety tool available to pilots. Recent advancements in technology are making modern autopilots an affordable addition to general aviation aircraft across the board. However, technology in the cockpit is only as good as the pilot using it. Understanding how and when to best use your autopilot can be the difference between it being a valuable safety tool vs. a dangerous distraction. 

 Join BendixKing’s Andrew Barker, VP of America’s Aftermarket and Experimental Sales with Steven Pearce, Product Marketing Manager and avid pilot, along with SocialFlight President, Jeff Simon, an A&amp;P-IA mechanic, as they discuss features and functions in the latest autopilots. Learn about the combined BendixKing and former TruTrak autopilot line, how to integrate them into your flying and what to look for in your next avionics upgrade.
Topics include:


	- A summary of autopilots (1/2/3-axis)
	- Modes, guidance and steering
	- Workload strategies
	- Integration with your other avionics
	- Other new products from BendixKing
