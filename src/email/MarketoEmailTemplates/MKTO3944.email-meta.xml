    <textOnly>Improve Operation and Reliability with Honeywell Common Color Multi-Function Display (CCMFD)
In 2009, Honeywell introduced the light-emitting diode (LED) backlight in the F-16 common color multi-function display (CCMFD). All fielded fluorescent backlight CCMFDs can be upgraded to the LED configuration.
The CCMFD LED back light is &quot;environmentally-friendly&quot; eliminating fluorescent bulbs to improve operation, increase reliability and resolve obsolescence issues. The LED also provides increased back light luminance in night vision imaging system (NVIS) mode to address operational problems and provide superior optical performance. The CCMFD LED features include:


	- Dual mode LED back light (day and NVIS modes)
	- 10X (NVIS) luminance increase capability
	- Drop-in retrofitting for existing CCMFD
	- Improved mean time between failures (MTBF) – 8000+ hours vs. 5000+ for legacy design


Today, Honeywell has partnered with Aero Precision to deliver this upgrade to operators worldwide. Plus, with Aero Precision, you can expect efficiency and effectiveness on your order. As a leading provider for the F-16, Aero Precision prides itself in being flexible, reliable and committed to quality.
