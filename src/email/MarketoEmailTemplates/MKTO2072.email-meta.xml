Your MyAerospace Portal &lt;[[https://myaerospace.honeywell.com/]]&gt; is getting faster and easier to use. 
We are improving our search capability &lt;[[https://myaerospace.honeywell.com/search]]&gt; next week to help you quickly find information and perform tasks.  From a common search, you&apos;ll be able to:


	- 
Either quickly find resources before logging in, or log in first to find results tailored to your profile, such as order status and cases. 

	- 
Search most-used tasks, such as ordering, repair capabilities, order status, publications, cases, and the website. 

	- 
Search by any detail, from part to PO number, and easily expand, filter or sort by relevance. 



Learn more by watching this video &lt;[[https://www.kaltura.com/tiny/np77l]]&gt;. 
In addition to the faster search functionality, MyAerospace &lt;[[https://myaerospace.honeywell.com/]]&gt; will also feature:


	- 
Easy access to AS9100 certificates &lt;[[https://myaerospace.honeywell.com/parts-and-repairs/downloads/honeywell-aerospace-as9100-certificates]]&gt;.

	- 
Pre-login technical support information – quickly learn about our capabilities and view search results before logging in. 



We have been simplifying your experience on MyAerospace, such as adding the ability for you to download your 8130 tag, find the right repair location, check order status or order repairs.  Keep track of all updates here &lt;[[https://myaerospace.honeywell.com/contact-us/myaerospace-updates]]&gt;. 
 
And, it’s even easier now to give us feedback, including enhancement suggestions.  Simply email us with as much information as possible at this email address &lt;[[mailto:myaerospaceportalissue@honeywell.com?subject=MyAerospace%20Portal%20Feedback]]&gt;.
