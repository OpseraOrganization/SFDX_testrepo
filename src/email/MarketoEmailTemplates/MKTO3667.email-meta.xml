Give passengers the connectivity they crave and keep a handle on costs with Honeywell’s first-ever “pay as you go” data plan for Inmarsat Jet ConneX. For a limited time, Honeywell is offering business jet owners and operators the chance to secure Jet ConneX service with no monthly data use commitment and no restrictions. 


With JetWave and Jet ConneX, passengers can send and receive email, surf the net, upload and download large files, and even stream live video – with speed, reliability, and availability similar to what they experience at home or in the office

There has never been a better time to get the connectivity you crave. Contact StandardAero, a Honeywell Authorized Avionics Dealer, today to learn more about the pay as you go data plan and schedule your JetWave installation.
