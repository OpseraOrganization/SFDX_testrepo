    <subject>Experience the TFE731 Engine at NBAA Like Never Before!</subject>
    <textOnly>Are you attending NBAA 2019 in Las Vegas?

 Be sure to stop by Duncan Aviationâ€™s booth (#N2506) for the opportunity to engage in a unique Virtual Reality (VR) experience. In this experience, you will be able to learn about and interact with a TFE731 engine and see it run in a virtual test cell. Participants who complete the experience will receive a special prize! You won&apos;t want to miss it. 

 In addition to the VR experience, Duncan Aviation will also highlight their full range of MRO and support services from Aircraft Sales and Acquisitions to Completions and Paint, and Airframe and Engine maintenance to Parts. The company will represent its three full-service facilities (Lincoln, Nebraska; Battle Creek, Michigan; and Provo, Utah) as well as its 25+ avionics satellite locations and worldwide Rapid Response Team engine services.
