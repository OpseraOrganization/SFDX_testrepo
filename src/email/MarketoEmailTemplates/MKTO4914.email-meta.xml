    <subject>Process Change | Vendor Managed Inventory (VMI) Updates</subject>
    <textOnly>Effective April 16, 2021, Honeywell will be discontinuing legacy Vendor Managed Inventory (VMI) 1.0 and 2.0 programs, and replacing them with Honeywell’s preferred VMI program, VMI Flex. In preparation for this change, Honeywell is seeking your assistance in transitioning these legacy programs into another PFEP (Plan For Every Part) delivery strategy before this date.

 WHAT ARE MY ACTIONS?

 Your Commodity Manager or a VMI Program Manager will be contacting you to: 
 

 	- Discuss the features and benefits of the VMI Flex program. 	- Work with you to transition any parts identified as VMI Flex candidates into the VMI Flex program and move all other non-VMI Flex candidate parts to another suitable delivery strategy. 	- Ensure you do not over-ship inventory of VMI Legacy parts. In most cases, Honeywell can return legacy VMI inventories that have yet to hit passage of time at the program’s end of life (April 16, 2021) that are not needed to support four weeks of forward-looking demand. 

 WHO DO I CONTACT WITH QUESTIONS?

 Please contact Christine Marshall &lt;[[mailto:Christine.marshall@honeywell.com]]&gt;, ISC Project Management Manager with any questions. Thank you for taking the time to understand these important changes.</textOnly>
