Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Customer}},
According to a study by the International Council on Clean Transportation &lt;[[https://www.theicct.org/publications/transpacific-airline-fuel-efficiency-ranking-2016]]&gt;, best-in-class airlines use up to 64 percent less fuel per passenger kilometer compared to other operators. How can your airline save fuel and a lot of money without sacrificing on-time performance? Simple – with the power of data analytics!

Honeywell’s GoDirect Flight Efficiency &lt;[[https://aerospace.honeywell.com/en/services/aerospace-services/godirect-flight-efficiency]]&gt; leverages 
existing flight data to enable airlines to achieve up to 5 percent fuel savings. The tool also provides unprecedented visibility into flight ops to drive efficiency in some of the most crowded, complex airspaces in the world – all with the goal of getting your passengers to their destinations on-time.
