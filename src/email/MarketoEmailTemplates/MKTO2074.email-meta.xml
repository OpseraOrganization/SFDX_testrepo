Dear Honeywell Customer, 
Recently, we told you about exciting new changes to your Honeywell MyAerospace Portal &lt;[[https://myaerospace.honeywell.com/]]&gt;.  It’s your home to place and track parts and repair orders.  Not only have we improved the way you can submit and view your orders, but more parts are now available. 
 
Please log into MyAerospace &lt;[[http://goaero.honeywell.com/O0x0000X0200ZQqh0E0Ge0I]]&gt; for all parts quoting, ordering, and tracking.  To get started, view updates and tutorials here &lt;[[http://goaero.honeywell.com/MZ0X0000Qx0eG00sq00I052]]&gt;.  If you need to reset your password, click the &quot;Sign In&quot; link. 
 
As we mentioned in a previous email, please ensure that moving forward you use the MyAerospace Portal for your order management. 


MyAerospace will open a world of convenience, dependability, and speed for your company.  It gives you immediate confirmation that your order has been placed and allows you to track its progress from any computer, tablet, or smartphone. 


We will continue making improvements to move your order from placed-to-delivered quickly.  Learn more about MyAerospace updates here &lt;[[http://goaero.honeywell.com/MZ0X0000Qx0eG00sq00I052]]&gt;.


Thank you for your business,
