    <subject>Update on our Anniston, Alabama Site</subject>
    <textOnly>&lt;[[https://aerospace.honeywell.com/]]&gt;

Dear Customer,
  
Our Honeywell Anniston, Alabama facility sustained storm damage yesterday.  Fortunately, our employees are safe.  The situation is currently being assessed, therefore at this time we cannot provide a timeline for returning to normal business operations.  We will work to minimize the impact to customer deliveries once normal business operations resume.
 
If you currently have units at our facility, we will provide a status update as soon as we are able. If you have units to send to Honeywell, please reference the Repair Capabilities &lt;[[https://myaerospace2.honeywell.com/onlineordering/repair-capabilities/]]&gt; application on the MyAerospace website to determine if an alternate Honeywell site has the appropriate capability.  If you do send a unit to the Anniston facility, we will hold the unit until the site returns to normal operations.
 
We are actively working with our site teams to assess and repair the damage and we will provide regular updates.  We assure you that we are doing everything possible to get the site operational.
 

Thank you for your business,
Honeywell Aerospace Customer &amp; Product Support
