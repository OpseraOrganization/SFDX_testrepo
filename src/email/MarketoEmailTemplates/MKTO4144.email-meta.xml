Fly into 2020 with improved efficiency and safety when you upgrade your aircraft with U.S. Domestic FANS and CPDLC from Honeywell with StandardAero.

PM-CPDLC is a retrofit solution that enables FAA NextGen Initiatives aimed at handling more traffic, reducing flight delays, routing aircraft more efficiently and improving safety, all while reducing operational costs for airspace users. With Honeywell’s PM-CPDLC pilots are experiencing significant reductions in pilot-controller communication time and readback errors, as well as reduced delays.

Upgrade now and take advantage of a 2018 U.S. tax code change allowing U.S. based aircraft owners using their aircraft for business purposes to write off 100% of the upgrade cost in the first year.

Be the best equipped! Contact StandardAero to request a quote or schedule your installation.
