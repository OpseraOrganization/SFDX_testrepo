Would you watch this at home? Not anymore! So, why trust this in the air? 
Tired of looking at flight information on a 25-year old CRT screen? Improve your pilot’s vision with the update of Honeywell’s DU-875* displays. 
 
The DU-875 is more than a screen update. It’s a completely new avionics system. Initially designed to overcome the obsolescence of CRT displays, the DU-875 also offers improved flight management tools, future growth capability and improved reliability. The best part? The DU-875 update doesn’t require additional pilot training or cabin modifications. 
 
Update one or all of your screens today and take advantage of a credit of USD $40,000 for each DU-870 when you purchase a DU-875, plus additional incentives in Honeywell’s Avionic Protection Plan.
