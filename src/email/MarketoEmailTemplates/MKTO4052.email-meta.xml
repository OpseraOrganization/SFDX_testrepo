IMPORTANT REMINDER
 HONEYWELL AEROSPACE RENTON, WA MOVE SCHEDULE 

 THIS EMAIL WAS ORIGINALLY SENT AUGUST 15, 2019

 We have been experiencing a high volume of repair unit receipts at the Renton site after the move has been completed. In order to complete your repairs in the most efficient method possible, please review the below schedule. 

Honeywell Aerospace recently announced the transition of the Honeywell Renton, Washington Repair &amp; Overhaul activity to the Honeywell Olathe, Kansas facility. To minimize risk and customer impact, this transition has been planned with five moves. The first move starts in September 2019 and all moves will be completed by late February 2020. This communication addresses all move schedules tied to the Renton work transfer. 

A review of repair order history (2 years) indicates that you have sent in a part number for repair for at least one of the impacted part numbers.

To minimize issues or delays with the repair of your hardware, please follow these guidelines and actions. 

Existing Repair Orders

	- If a modification is required, your Honeywell Customer Business Manager, Honeywell Contracts Manager or Honeywell Support Representative will contact you to advise and coordinate the activity.


	- Watch for PO or contract modification correspondence coming from AeroRepairs@Honeywell.com.




New Repair Orders 



	- To minimize delays to your repair, ensure that new repair orders are sent to the correct location.
	- Part numbers received on or before the ‘Renton Last Receipt Date’ will be accepted at Renton.
	- Honeywell will send part numbers that are in transit and received within 7 days of the ‘Renton Last Receipt Date’ to Olathe for repair.


	- A PO/contract modification may be required.
