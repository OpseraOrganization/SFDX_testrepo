Dear Customer,   &lt;[[http://goaero.honeywell.com/R00q00oI0G002000QQXh7Z0]]&gt;


As part of our normal business process, Honeywell continually looks for ways to better serve customers more efficiently and cost-effectively. After an extensive evaluation, we have decided to move all repair and overhaul operations from Greer, South Carolina to Phoenix, Arizona by June 2019. Laser cladding/grinding, plasma spray, fluoride ion cleaning, and vacuum ovens will remain at Greer but will move under their original equipment manufacturing operations. 
 
Overall, we expect this transition to be seamless for you and do not anticipate any disruptions in service. We will move the work in phases, so in the meantime, please continue to place your repair request as usual. We will update you once we have new instructions for repairs. 
 
If you have any questions, please email or call your primary Honeywell contact.   
 
Our goal is to always provide you with the quality and service that you deserve.
 
Honeywell Aerospace
