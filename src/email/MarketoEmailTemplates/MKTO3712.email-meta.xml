Better In-Flight Wi-Fi with Limited Downtime

Now it’s easier than ever to get the best in-flight Wi-Fi – Honeywell’s breakthrough JetWave™ satellite communications system is a quick install in your business aircraft. In fact, most installations can be completed in about two weeks, meaning you can fold your SATCOM upgrade into a scheduled service interval, ensuring limited downtime. 

JetWave uses a tail-mounted antenna, which easily replaces your current L-band or Ku-band antenna. With Honeywell hardware and the JetConneX Ka-band network from Inmarsat, you’ve got everything you need to stay connected, productive and entertained with a reliable in-flight experience anywhere you fly. 

Contact Pentastar Aviation to learn about current JetWave price reductions and installation that will get you back in the air quickly!
