    <subject>Who Needs Another Tie?</subject>
    <textOnly>There’s nothing quite like Dad’s sense of humor. So, for this Father’s Day, say thanks for all the jokes, and for everything else, buy with GoDirect Trade—the world’s largest marketplace for used and new aerospace parts. We make buying more convenient by being open 24/7, and we can deliver the product to wherever you want. So, this year, don’t just buy another tie; buy something that will make your dad even more fly. (Okay sorry, we will leave the jokes to the pros.) 

 To all the fathers and father figures, we thank you!
