2019 ANNUAL CUSTOMER APPRECIATION EVENT
YOU ARE INVITED!
Dear Customers,

It’s going to be an exciting AirVenture in Oshkosh this year at the BendixKing Pavilion. From new products and services to complete integrated flight decks, we’ll have on display everything you’ll need to upgrade your experimental and certified aircraft.

Register for our Annual Customer Appreciation Event on July 23 at our Pavilion #292, where you can enjoy food and beverages with our team members and celebrate our 60th Anniversary, while learning about our experimental and certified aircraft solutions. Register today, as our popular event is space-limited.
