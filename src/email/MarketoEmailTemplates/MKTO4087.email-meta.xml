While it is true that today&apos;s avionics equipment is more reliable than ever, it is also more complex. When things go wrong, repair costs and downtime can have a more significant impact on your bottom line than ever before, and unplanned failures and expenses can blow your entire budget. 

Honeywell&apos;s Maintenance Service Plan for Avionics offers fixed pricing plans based on important facts such as flying hours, so you can select the right coverage option for your unique needs, and take the guesswork out of determining your annual maintenance budget.
