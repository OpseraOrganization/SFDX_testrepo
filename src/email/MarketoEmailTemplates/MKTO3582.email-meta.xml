    <subject>Important Update About Honeywell&apos;s Tucson, AZ Facility</subject>
    <textOnly>&lt;[[https://aerospace.honeywell.com/]]&gt;

Dear Honeywell Customer,
In December, we informed you that we are working with our strategic partner, Celestica, to assume responsibility of some manufacturing and aftermarket operations at our Tucson, Arizona site. As mentioned, the manufacturing, repair, overhaul and test work will remain at the site and Honeywell will remain the design and manufacturing authority with all parts continuing to be labeled Honeywell.  Product support will not change.  
To facilitate this transition, we will be updating our enterprise resource planning system from now until September 5th, 2017.  We are committed to minimizing the impact as much as possible.
 
During this time, new and existing order status updates will not be visible.  While you will be able to submit new orders, you will not receive a confirmed ship date.  For these new orders, any visible ship date on the MyAerospace Portal or through your customer service representative will reflect your request date until the update is complete on September 5th.  For orders received before August 26th, order status visibility will reflect the planned ship date available before August 26th and will not reflect any changes.
 
This does not impact any AOG shipments. 
 
We apologize in advance for any inconvenience this may cause. Again, this only impacts orders processed by our Tucson plant (filter or view MyAerospace Order Status by “Honeywell site”). 
Please share this information with others in your company. If you have questions or concerns, please contact your Honeywell representative or visit MyAerospace &lt;[[http://goaero.honeywell.com/tGX0200VQ00qK00ZI0000gX]]&gt; for updates.  
Sincerely, 
Steve Kersh | Rich DeGraff
