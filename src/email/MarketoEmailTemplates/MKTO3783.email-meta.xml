    <subject>RE: Take Advantage of Recent Price Reductions and Upgrade to JetWave</subject>
    <textOnly>&lt;[[https://aerospace.honeywell.com/]]&gt;

Honeywell’s JetWave™ allows you to download huge files, videoconference with colleagues or customers, and video chat with friends and family on the tarmac or at 30,000 feet. As a highly reliable Wi-Fi solution, JetWave provides a similar connectivity experience you receive at your home or office. 


Don’t miss your chance to install JetWave at its lowest price to date! Contact Pentastar Aviation learn more and take advantage of recently reduced pricing, as well as the new pay-as-you-go plan for Jet ConneX service. But hurry - this price reduction on JetWave hardware ends December 31, 2019!
