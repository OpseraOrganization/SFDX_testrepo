It’s the final count down for ADS-B Compliance and service centers across the country are at capacity. Flightstar, a Honeywell Authorized Avionics Dealer, currently has three remaining slots for ADS-B out installations. 


And, since the FAA recently issued the STC for Primus Elite upgrades for Lear 45, Flightstar is offering a special promotion to customers. For a limited time, upgrade at least two of your DU-870 displays and Flightstar will waive the cost of the STC for your ADS-B out installation (a $7,000 value). You’ll also save $35,000 per display thanks to Honeywell trade-in credits (through 12/31/2019) and be eligible for incentives on your Honeywell Maintenance Service Plan contract. 

If you still need to complete your ADS-B out installation to meet the 2020 FAA deadline, Flightstar is here to help.
