    <subject>MyAerospace Portal:  Your Online Ordering Experience Just Got Easier</subject>
    <textOnly>Your MyAerospace Portal &lt;[[http://goaero.honeywell.com/tGX0200cQ00qt00ZI0000er]]&gt; just keeps getting faster and easier to use. 

Not only have we redesigned your homepage, navigation, and performance so you can reach your destination quickly, but the new online ordering application will transform your parts and repair order experience. 

We have been working hard to simplify your interactions on MyAerospace, such as adding the ability to download your 8130 tag, find the right repair location, and search for technical solutions. Learn more about these updates here &lt;[[http://goaero.honeywell.com/CI000G0Fq0bQ0ZG0200eX00]]&gt;. 

Your new online ordering application will help you: 





Place a repair order efficiently and quickly

Simply select the repair type from search results, provide basic information, and configure your repair, such as selecting service bulletins and certifications. We will generate documentation for you to print to ship your order.










Shorten your checkout with new profiles

Create profiles to make placing orders for multiple accounts and destinations simple with profile preferences automatically populated during search and checkout.








Access the latest available pricing

Your most recent pricing will always be reflected when you place your orders through MyAerospace.










Save your progress with our new shopping cart

Create orders, add items, and remain confident leaving them there if you get interrupted. Just return and continue, without losing your work. And when you order, use your credit card when applicable.





Learn more &lt;[[http://goaero.honeywell.com/tGX0200bQ00qF00ZI0000eE]]&gt; and view a video on these latest enhancements.

 And don’t forget, the Order Status tool helps you stay updated on your order progress - you can customize status reports and have them sent automatically when you need them, review and approve quotes and order changes real-time. 

 We will continue to enhance your MyAerospace experience to make it easier to do business with us. Stay updated &lt;[[http://goaero.honeywell.com/CI000G0Fq0bQ0ZG0200eX00]]&gt;.
