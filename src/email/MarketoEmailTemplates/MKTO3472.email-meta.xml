HONEYWELL AEROSPACE | CHANNEL PARTNERS
YOUR OPINION MATTERS. 
Tell us how we&apos;re doing!
Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Valued Partner}},

Over the last two years, Honeywell&apos;s Channel Partner program has undergone a number of changes. If you haven&apos;t already, we would appreciate it if you could take a few minutes to share your thoughts and feedback via a brief, anonymous survey. We have extended the survey deadline through April 29th. 





TAKE OUR SURVEY! &lt;[[https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/S36ZWK9]]&gt;




The survey is intended for individuals familiar with the channel partner relationship. If you are receiving this email and are not involved in the management of the channel partner program with Honeywell, please disregard or forward to the appropriate person within your organization. 

Information collected from the survey will be used internally to continue to improve the Channel Partner program, and better enable your operational success.

Thank you for your candid feedback and for being a Honeywell Channel Partner.
