Get ready for six updated releases.
With constant, rapid growth in new airports and runways, more EGPWS data more often is essential.
That’s why Honeywell created an all-new EGPWS terrain subscription that increases the frequency of update releases to six per year. So unanticipated changes can be implemented sooner, and keep your fleet smarter, and safer.

No action is required today. 

Next time you login to download an update, we may ask you to choose a subscription plan. What if you&apos;re not prompted to pick a plan? Don&apos;t worry! Our services team will be reaching out to you to discuss the types of plans available to your operations.
We&apos;ve created two plans to best fit your needs:
Plan 1:  Six (6) update releases for $500 per year, with built-in fleet options.
Plan 2:  One (1) update per year at no charge. Additional updates available as a &quot;pay as you go&quot; payment for $200 per aircraft per release. 


Prepare to lock in your six essential updates.
You’ll find the information you’ll receive well worth the subscription price. With proactive notifications on new or modified runways, changes in RAAS, SR/SL, and ROPS runway status and more – all with the ability to customize the new information to your operator’s specific destination or alternative airports.
