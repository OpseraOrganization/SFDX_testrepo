The DU-875 and HAPP Upgrade for Learjet 40/45 by Honeywell and Duncan Aviation

Protect more than $850,000 of avionics in your Learjet 40 or 45 with Honeywell’s Avionics Protection Plan. For a limited time, you can save 15% on your new HAPP contract when you sign up before June 30.
As an added bonus, you can take advantage of the DU-870 to DU-875 LCD display replacement program, which allows you to exchange a failed DU-870 for a DU-875. 

If your old CRTs are still functioning, but you&apos;d like to ditch your old displays for new DU-875&apos;s, Honeywell is currently offering a trade-in credit for Learjet 40 and 45 operators. For a limited time, you can save up to $160,000* when you trade-in all four displays.

Contact Duncan Aviation today to take advantage of these special offers.

Act now, this offer expires June 30.
