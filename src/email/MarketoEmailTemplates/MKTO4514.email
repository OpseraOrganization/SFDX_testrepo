<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 14px; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Recently, one of my team members tried to reach you to talk to you about our Laseref IV upgrade and told me you mentioned that price was an issue. <br /><br /> Aside from our current trade-in promotion, did you know that by upgrading to Laseref IV, you can actually lower your cost of ownership? <br /><br /> This Laseref IV is lighter, more reliable, offers standard communication bus digital outputs and improved maintenance, which provides the lowest cost of ownership for inertial reference systems <br /><br /> Iâ€™d love to chat with you more about why many of our customers have made the switch already. <br /><br /> Is there a day/time that works best for you for us to connect? </span>
<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 14px; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"> I look forward to hearing from you. </span>
<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 14px; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"> Sincerely, </span>
<br />
<br />
