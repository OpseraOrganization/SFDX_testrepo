    <subject>MSP Propulsion: Still Powering Business Aviation After 40 Years</subject>
    <textOnly>&lt;[[https://aerospace.honeywell.com/]]&gt;
Dear Customer, 

 For more than 40 years, Honeywell and Dallas Airmotive have been supporting customers and operators of Honeywell engines and auxiliary power units. In that time, Honeywell’s Maintenance Service Plan (MSP) has become the most trusted and highly valued aftermarket program. The legacy MSP program has recently been renamed as the Maintenance Service Plan (Propulsion) however, it continues to offer operators the same benefits—and the same peace of mind! 

 MSP Propulsion takes the stress out of maintaining your aircraft engines. With MSP, you can avoid expensive engine downtime, manage your annual maintenance costs and rest easy knowing you’ve got Honeywell’s network of world-renowned maintenance, repair and overhaul capabilities on your side – whenever and wherever you need them. 

 To learn more about Honeywell&apos;s MSP Propulsion plan and see why the program remains the first and only choice for so many operators worldwide, contact Dallas Airmotive by clicking below.
