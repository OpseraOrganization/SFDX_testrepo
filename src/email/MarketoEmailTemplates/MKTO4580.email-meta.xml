    <subject>Meet the LASEREF IV Upgrade by Honeywell and Clay Lacy</subject>
    <textOnly>The LASEREF IV inertial reference system (IRS) contains ring laser gyro and accelerometers that are designed to perform over the entire range of Aerospace environments while delivering very stable performance.  



	- Simplify crew workload
	- Dramatically reduced weight, size, power, cost, and downtime
	- 30% improvement in reliability
	- 35% weight reduction
	- Uses considerably less power
	- Lowest cost of ownership of any IRS flying today!
	- Trade-in credit with return of LASEREF II and LASEREF III units



The LASEREF IV replaces the aging LASEREF II and III, which became obsolete in 2019 and are no longer supported by Honeywell.
Schedule your upgrade to the new industry standard with Honeywell and its authorized dealer, Clay Lacy Aviation.
