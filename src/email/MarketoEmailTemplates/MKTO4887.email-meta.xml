    <subject>Why upgrade to LASEREF IV now?</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear customer, 
No one knows more about inertial reference systems (IRS) than Honeywell, the company that pioneered IRS technology more than two decades ago with our signature LASEREF product line. 
Our latest LASEREF IV system for business aircraft sets new standards for performance and reliability and it’s now available at a very attractive price. 
So, why upgrade now? 
Starting January 1st, 2021, the current promotional pricing will be subject to a 5% increase. Furthermore, the currently available generous trade-in credit of  US$52,500 per unit will be reduced to just US$26,250!   
Don&apos;t miss this exciting savings opportunity. The simple unit replacement is lighter, more reliable and offers a cost-effective solution with significant financial savings!
