    <subject>Keep Costs in Control with Jet ConneX Pay-As-You-Go Data Plan!</subject>
    <textOnly>&lt;[[https://aerospace.honeywell.com/]]&gt;

Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Customer}},

Picking the right data plan shouldn’t be intimidating. You shouldn’t have to guess how much data you and your passengers will use ahead of time, commit to a plan so big you end up leaving gigabytes on the table, or run the risk of high data overage costs for underestimating your plan needs. 
 
 Get the connectivity you crave and keep a handle on costs with Honeywell’s first-ever “pay as you go” data plan for Inmarsat Jet ConneX. With the pay-as-you-go plan, you’ll have no monthly data-use commitment and no restrictions. 
 
 If you have been thinking about installing JetWaveTM but the cost 
of service has been holding you back, there has never been a better time to get connected. But act now, enrollment in the new pay-as-you-go plan is limited!  Contact Pentastar Aviation to learn more.
