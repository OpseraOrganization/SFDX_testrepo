    <subject>Notification: Are you ADS-B Out ready?</subject>
    <textOnly>The big date is looming for European aircraft operators. 
Are you ADS-B Out ready?
By June 2020, you must be equipped with ADS-B Out avionics that meet the performance requirements of the fast approaching mandate. Failure to comply could put your operations at risk, as well as being denied access to flying in ADS-B Out airspace. 

Europe’s ADS-B Out mandate is applicable to aircraft with a maximum take-off weight of 5,700 kg/12,500 lbs. and maximum cruise velocity above 250 ktas. Nearly a thousand-aircraft operating in European airspace are at risk of not being ADS-B Out compliant by the time the region’s airspace equipage mandate becomes effective next year. 

Don&apos;t let this be you, Honeywell is certified and ready to help.
