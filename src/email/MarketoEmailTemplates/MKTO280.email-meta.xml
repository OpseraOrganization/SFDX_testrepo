    <textOnly>Dear Customer,

The Honeywell GDC is pleased to announce that the MyGDC enhancements you&apos;ve been hearing about are now here.  User migration to a new Honeywell ID has started for website users, and once complete users will have access to account management features, other Honeywell online tools, as well as increased online security. The migration for iPad users will start next week. To begin the migration process please visit MyGDC.com &lt;https://www.mygdc.com/new/index.php/manager/home&gt;.

What this means:


 - Current users with a GDC ID are required to create a new Honeywell ID in order to log in to mygdc.com
 - iPad users will need to download v 3.5 of the MyGDC app, now available on the Apple store
 - Migration to a Honeywell ID must be complete by June 30th, after which time users’ GDC IDs will no longer be active



New MyGDC enhancements:


 - Single Sign On – Login once to the Honeywell Aerospace Portal or pilots.honeywell.com and switch to myGDC.com seamlessly
 - Self-management of credentials – users will be able to change their password, recover a forgotten password, change their user information and retrieve a forgotten username using our online tool
 - Improved online security
