    <subject>Honeywell Announces New Leadership Changes in Sourcing &amp; Procurement</subject>
    <textOnly>Assuming the role of Bob Buddecke, who was promoted to a new opportunity within Honeywell, I would like to personally thank you for the tremendous efforts put forth in 2020 in the face of a global health crisis that caused unprecedented levels of distress to the industry. 

 Together, weâ€™ve overcome incredibly difficult situations by demonstrating significant adaptability, resilience, and flexibility to support our customers when they needed us the most. These circumstances forced us to act quickly and find ways to implement safety measures protecting our employees while remaining operational as essential contributors to economies worldwide. 

 Amid all of this, we simultaneously worked to improve quality and delivery. This collaborative effort garnered an almost 15% improvement in Honeywell receiving parts on time with a significant reduction in past dues. These metrics are critical to our mutual success, ensuring that we were able to meet our customer commitments. We could not have accomplished what we did this year without your support! 

 While there is still a great deal of work ahead as we prepare for a potential spike in the market, there is no better time than now to look for ways to differentiate ourselves from our competitors. This starts with being hyper-focused on reducing historically long lead times by reducing cycle time, simplifying our supply chains, and eliminating waste. Delivering perfect quality is critical because our industry and customers expect flawless products and need our support now more than ever. Please be on the lookout for communication from Honeywell in the beginning part of this year, soliciting your ideas and support in reducing cycle time. Together, we can partner to proactively prepare for industry recovery and growth. 

 Thank you for all you do for Honeywell. We are honored to have you as our business partner and truly appreciate your continued dedication to delivering quality parts on-time, every time. I wish you all a safe and prosperous 2021 and look forward to another successful year partnering with you to transform the Aerospace industry together!
