    <textOnly>Hi {{lead.First Name:default=there}}, 

 Aside from the fact that your current Laseref II or IIIs are no longer covered by our MSP Avionics plan, Honeywell is providing trade-in incentives for customers who complete the upgrade in 2020. 

 Also, if your aircraft is scheduled for routine maintenance or isn&apos;t flying as a result of COVID-19, this is the perfect time to upgrade your aircraft without impacting your flying schedule. 

 If you have any questions about what I just shared, please feel free to connect with me directly. I’m here to help. 

 I look forward to hearing from you. 

 Sincerely, 

{{lead.ABM Sales Rep:default=Perry Pelitera}}
