    <subject>Important Alert from BendixKing</subject>
    <textOnly>&lt;[[http://www.bendixking.com/]]&gt;
BendixKing Channel Partners, 
 
  It has been brought to our attention that there is a phishing scam circulating via email that requests urgent information from BendixKing. Please be aware that BendixKing did not send this out this notification. It appears that the email comes from info@bendixking.com but in reality, is not from BendixKing. This is a phishing email where someone is pretending to be BendixKing by ghosting the email address. Please note that the sending email address is from a Gmail account, while the display name looks like a BendixKing email address.  
 
 BendixKing is unable to correct this internally. We recommend you inform IT/Security group to help block messages from “payable.deptm@gmail[.]com.” 
 
 Best Regards, 
 
 Roger Dykmann 
 Director Sales, BendixKing Leadership</textOnly>
