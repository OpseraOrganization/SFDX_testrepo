    <textOnly>Hi {{lead.First Name:default=there}},

I&apos;ve reached out a few times to see if it makes sense to connect regarding our HGuide IMUs and inertial navigation systems.

 Since I haven&apos;t heard back, I&apos;ll assume the timing isn&apos;t right.

 In the meantime, 
here are some resources that serve as resources to help you find the right IMU or inertial navigation system that meets your needs:
