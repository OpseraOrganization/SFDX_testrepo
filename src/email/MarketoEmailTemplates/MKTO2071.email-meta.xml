    <subject>Tech Tips - Improve oil pressure and prevent static oil leaks on TFE731 engines</subject>
    <textOnly>&lt;[[https://aerospace.honeywell.com/]]&gt;

Are you experiencing reduced oil pressure or static oil leaks on a TFE731-2/3/4/5 engine?  
 
Because of the installed angle of some right-hand engine installations and an oil drain-back issue using a previous part, it&apos;s possible that oil can be observed leaking from the No. 6 carbon seal area and/or the accessory gearbox breather pressurizing valve. 


If this happens, Service Bulletin TFE731-79-3064  &lt;[[https://myaerospace.honeywell.com/search#q=TFE731-79-3064&amp;sort=relevancy]]&gt;recommends that you replace oil lube pump part number 3060785-3 with 3071949-12. This service bulletin may be used instead of TFE731-79-3059 or TFE731-79-3066 (as applicable) to prevent static oil leaks at the No. 6 bearing/seal cavity.
 
Static oil leaks are not a grounding item and Honeywell recommends that this service bulletin be implemented during the next scheduled oil pump removal.
