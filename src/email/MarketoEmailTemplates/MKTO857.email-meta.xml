Aside from the name, the redesign highlights value props for each audience, adds an “estimated downtime” section, and promotes links to helpful videos, web pages and brochures. We hope your customers will ask what’s NEXT.

FAQ&apos;S
Q: Why does my Sales bulletin special pricing disappear when I submit my PO?
A: Customer Service Representative (CSR) in Honeywell knows how to find the Sales/Service Bulletin (SB) in the portal. If a customer is ordering a part that has special pricing in the SB, they need to specify that in their PO, otherwise CSR will not be aware of the SB pricing. To avoid confusion and delays specify this in the initial PO. CSR will refer to SB and manually update the price in SAP. In some case, for service letters, some parts do not have price specified, CSR will contact Customer Business Manager to verify the price. When the customer is placing an order with pricing as per a SB, they should mention the same on the PO copy along with document number so that CSR can pull from technical publication section in My Aerospace portal and validate.

Q: What if I have a STC I would like included in the newsletter?
A: If your STC meets baseline Honeywell installation requirements, submit it, along with your contact information to our review team at BGAChannel@Honeywell.com &lt;[[mailto:BGAChannel@Honeywell.com]]&gt;. As a bonus, we will also contact you for creating a co-branded campaign to get the word out!

Q: What if I have other Sales / Marketing questions?
A: Email the Channel Team at: BGAChannel@Honeywell.com &lt;[[mailto:BGAChannel@Honeywell.com]]&gt;.
