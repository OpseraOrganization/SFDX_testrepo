    <subject>Changes to Honeywell Aerospace Operations in Asia</subject>
    <textOnly>&lt;[[https://aerospace.honeywell.com/]]&gt;

Dear Customer:
As part of our continuing efforts to improve service and cost efficiencies for you, Honeywell Aerospace has decided to consolidate some of its operations. We will close our Bintan Island, Indonesia and Chai Chee, Singapore sites, moving work from both locations to our facility in Penang, Malaysia.
We expect this transition to be complete by Q2 2018.
 
This transition should be seamless for you and does not change how you do business with Honeywell. We have established a dedicated transition team composed of functional experts and leaders from throughout Honeywell Aerospace to manage the transition process and ensure there is no break in service or shipments during this period.   
We’ll continue to provide you with updates as we work to complete the transition. In the meantime, if you have any questions, please contact your Honeywell customer support manager.  If you don&apos;t have a contact, please access the MyAerospace Portal for contact information &lt;[[https://myaerospace.honeywell.com/contact-us]]&gt; or to submit a question. 
We’re working to always give you the quality and the service you deserve. As always, we appreciate your business. 
 




Thank you for your business,
Honeywell Aerospace Customer &amp; Product Support
