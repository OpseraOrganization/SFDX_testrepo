    <subject>Narrow-format Flight Deck Printer Licensing to AstroNova</subject>
    <textOnly>&lt;[[https://aerospace.honeywell.com/]]&gt;

Dear Customer:
 
As part of our normal business process, Honeywell continually evaluates our business lines to determine how they fit into our long-term strategy. We have decided to license the manufacturing and servicing of our narrow-format flight deck printers to AstroNova. This affects manufacturing and services operations for the product line at our Penang, Loyang, Renton, and Olathe sites. We are still finalizing the details with AstroNova, but expect they will start making and servicing the product line early next year. 
 
We expect the transition to be seamless for you. We have established a dedicated transition team with leaders from Honeywell Aerospace and AstroNova to manage the transition process and ensure there is no break in service or shipments during this period. Our commitment to customer service does not wane during a transition. 
 
We view this exclusive license agreement with AstroNova as a benefit for you because they are a leading manufacturer of cockpit printers today. 
 
We’ll continue to provide you with updates as we work to complete the transition. In the meantime, if you have any questions, please contact your Honeywell representative.
