Flight delays have more than doubled in the last year alone. In 2018, the average delay per flight was 1.73 minutes, which exceeds EU targets by 246%. Airlines, airports and ground handling service providers are under pressure to reduce turnaround times. 
Honeywell Forge RampÂ addresses these concerns by providing real-time monitoring, visualization and data insights to reduce turn times, reduce operational costs, and reduce aircrafts delays unlike existing manual processes. This is enabled by securely collecting aircraft and system operator data, and provide actionable insights to improve operational awareness and put the right resources, at the right location, at the right time
