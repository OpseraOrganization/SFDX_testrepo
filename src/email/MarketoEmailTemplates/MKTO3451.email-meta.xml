    <textOnly>&lt;[[https://aerospace.honeywell.com/]]&gt;
Dear Customer,
The Sort Codes and International Bank Account Numbers (IBAN) are changing for Honeywell entities located in the United Kingdom that bank with Barclays. This change is being made to comply with new U.K. banking regulations, according to this notice to Honeywell &lt;[[https://pages3.honeywell.com/rs/641-QIX-912/images/SRPConfirmation_LetterfromBarclaystoHW_Jan2018.pdf]]&gt;.
To continue making payments to Honeywell electronically, please change these numbers in your payment systems. The change will be implemented in the Honeywell systems and banking systems on 14 February and will then be visible on all invoices. Payments will be accepted after this date against the old bank details, but we need you to update your systems before 1 March.
The Sort Code for all Honeywell U.K. entities will change to 201182.
The IBAN is different for each entity and are listed in this document &lt;[[https://pages3.honeywell.com/rs/641-QIX-912/images/SortCodesIBAN_Changes_Feb8_2018.pdf]]&gt;.
