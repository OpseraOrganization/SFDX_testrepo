    <subject>In-flight streaming that lets you breathe easy</subject>
    <textOnly>You know the feeling. You’re on the corporate jet and need to videoconference with an important customer, investor or colleague on the ground. You hold your breath until the connection is made. 

 Weeks later, you hold your breath again when you tear open your airtime service bill. Video streaming gets expensive and (surprise!) you&apos;ve exceeded your airtime service plan limits for the month.

 You can breathe easy with Honeywell on your side.

 For starters, our JetWave satellite communications system offers the best connectivity going with in-flight Wi-Fi so fast and reliable you’ll forget you’re flying. 

 Then you’ve got Honeywell Forge, our all-in-one cabin connectivity and flight services platform, which makes it easy to connect, stay connected and manage costs &lt;[[https://aerospace.honeywell.com/en/learn/about-us/blogs/2020/03/say-goodbye-data-sticker-shock?utm_source=email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=20_honeywellforge_bga&amp;utm_content=nurture]]&gt;. Honeywell Forge can save you up to $100,000 a year per aircraft. 

 That’s a breath of fresh air.
