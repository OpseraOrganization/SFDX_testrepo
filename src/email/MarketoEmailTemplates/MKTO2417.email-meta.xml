    <textOnly>&lt;[[https://aerospace.honeywell.com/]]&gt;      &lt;[[https://www.duncanaviation.aero/]]&gt;

Add new life to your Primus Epic® cockpit and improve situational awareness with Honeywell’s control display system/retrofit (CDS/R) upgrade for Falcon 900A/B. 
 
With CDS/R, you can control your newly added flight management system, graphical weather data, charts and maps, and more all on new Honeywell DU-1080 displays. Plus, CDS/R integrates seamlessly with existing equipment and sensors, making it more cost-effective and easy to install. 
 
To show Honeywell’s commitment to supporting CDS/R, Falcon 900A/B operators who upgrade are eligible for one free year of HAPP after installation has been complete, and a $10,000 discount off years 2 and 3 of their 3-year or 5-year contract. As an added benefit, Honeywell is offering fixed year-over-year pricing on 5-year contracts. 
 
Hurry, this offer expires Dec. 31, 2018. Contact Duncan Aviation to schedule your upgrade today.
