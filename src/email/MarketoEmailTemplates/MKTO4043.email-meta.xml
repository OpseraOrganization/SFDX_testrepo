    <subject>See Why Thousands Have Extended Their Aircraft Warranty with MSP!</subject>
    <textOnly>&lt;[[https://aerospace.honeywell.com/]]&gt;

Honeywell&apos;s signature Maintenance Service Plan (MSP) is like an extended warranty available on a home, car or major appliance, but for your aircraft.  Business aircraft operators simply choose the coverage that best meets their needs, pay an annual usage-based fee, and stop worrying about the devastating impact of an unplanned equipment failure on their operations and maintenance budget. 

Don&apos;t believe in extended warranties? 

While it&apos;s true that some operators prefer a &quot;pay as you go&quot; approach to aircraft maintenance, this is unreliable and can quickly become unmanageable. Unexpected failures happen and when they do the cost of parts and labor can mount up quickly. We&apos;ve seen customers spend as much as six figures replacing a component when they could have covered the cost of the cockpit or whole system at a fraction of the cost of the repair!

Control your costs and keep your plane flying! Contact Spirit Aeronautics today to learn more about Honeywell MSP or request a customized quote based on your needs.
