    <subject>Reminder: Classic Flight Planning System Sunsets May 31, 2020</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear Valued Customer, 

 We are sharing a quick reminder that our classic flight planning system will be sunsetting on May 31, 2020. This change will affect the Flight Bag Pro application as well as the flight planning website (flightservices.honeywell.com &lt;[[flightservices.honeywell.com]]&gt;) 

 What Options do I have? 

 We are thrilled to welcome customers who haven’t taken advantage of our next generation 
flight planning system to give it a try. We’ve overhauled our flight planning offering with a next generation website and mobile app that helps you create, compute and file flight plans faster, easier and more accurate than ever before. 

 How to Access the New Flight Planning System
 Log into flightservices.honeywell.com &lt;[[flightservices.honeywell.com]]&gt; and start a flight plan. Both the flight bag pro and the flight planning website default to the next generation system. If you have bookmarked the classic flight planning system after May 31, 2020 you will be redirected to our new flight planning system.

 After May 31, 2020



	- You will no longer be able to access the classic system.
	- You will be able to see what you’ve computed in the classic system, but will not be able to edit or modify those flight plans.
