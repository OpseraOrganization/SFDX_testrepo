Dear {{lead.First Name:default=customer}},

Recently, we sent you an invitation to try the new Beta Flight Planning experience from Honeywell GoDirect™.

If you’ve already tried our beta website or Flight Bag Pro beta app, thank you! Let us know what you think by emailing us at godirectfeedback@honeywell.com &lt;[[mailto:godirectfeedback@honeywell.com]]&gt;.

If you haven’t tried our Beta Flight Planning Experience yet, it’s easy to get started by clicking the Get Started button below. 

You’ll experience our completely overhauled flight planning experience on both our beta website and beta Flight Bag Pro app.

In the coming weeks here are some of the benefits you will see:



	- The use of flight management system (FMS) algorithm’s in conjunction with original equipment manufacturer (OEM) performance data for more accurate flight planning performance calculations. 

	- 4D flight planning optimization which considers time when creating a route.

	- More Eurocontrol flight plans cleared as filed using our new B2B connection.

	- Improved efficiency with route overlays, mapping and tracking to plan routes that match your goals. 

	- Saved time with faster speeds when computing a flight plan.
