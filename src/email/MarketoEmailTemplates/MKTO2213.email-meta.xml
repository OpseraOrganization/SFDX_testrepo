Dear Customer,


Did you know that if your fleet has Honeywell avionics on board you could fix your annual avionics maintenance costs by signing up for the Honeywell&apos;s Avionics Protection Plan (HAPP)? What’s more, with flexible payment terms, your budgeting process will be easier! Unplanned or unbudgeted minor repairs can cost in excess of $50,000 and major repairs and exchanges considerably more. With an annual HAPP contract costing on average $40,000*, you can avoid unplanned maintenance costs, downtime and unnecessary stress. After all, when it comes to your aircraft, time is money!

*HAPP annual cost does vary per airframe and flight hours, above is based on AW139.
