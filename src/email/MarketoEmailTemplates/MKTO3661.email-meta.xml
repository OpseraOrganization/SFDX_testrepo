Dear Customer,

Visit us in our BendixKing Pavilion at Booth #292 in Oshkosh, WI, during EAA’s 50th AirVenture event July 22 – July 28 and demo our innovative line-up of products specific to experimental aircraft. On display this year - with a full BendixKing cockpit - is a Lancair Legacy, built around the award-winning xVue Touch display. This cutting-edge display will move you into the future with embedded features and options that typically take up premium panel real estate. Save even more panel space by adding an xCruze 100 autopilot, with three compact form factors to fit existing cut-outs. 

Stop by to learn more about our experimental aircraft products such as the xVue Touch and xCruze 100 and ask about our 60th Anniversary show specials!

As a reminder, if you haven’t registered for our Annual Customer Appreciation Event 
on July 23, you can do so below. Keep in mind spots are limited!
