    <subject>Zero upfront costs to start virtual consignment with Honeywell</subject>
    <textOnly>Do you have excess or surplus inventory lying around? Do you want to sell your inventory but you’re not equipped to handle sales operations? If you are, save yourself the headaches and enlist Honeywell Aerospace Trading to sell your parts. 

 We’ve taken the hassle out of selling inventory so that you can put more cash into your pocket. Here are the 3-easy steps:



	- Contact HAT (paul.mendoza@honeywell.com &lt;[[mailto:paul.mendoza@honeywell.com?subject=Honeywell Aerospace Trading]]&gt;) to enter into a virtual consignment agreement.
	- HAT will take responsibility for all aspects of the selling process. We will prepare your listings (price, product images and quality paperwork uploading), field all customer calls and inquiries, and we will promote your products globally. All of your inventory will be accessible on the revolutionary GoDirect Trade marketplace.
	- When we sell your inventory, you ship the product directly from your location and HAT will charge a nominal selling fee that is negotiated up front (no surprises).


That’s it. You don’t pay a thing unless we do our jobs and make the sale. It can’t get any easier than that! 

 Zero upfront costs to start selling your inventory today.
