As a leader in Connected Utilities, Honeywell has surveyed several customers, suppliers and employees to better understand what’s important to utility companies as they move to a connected workforce.

Among improving safety and keeping their members’ costs low, utility companies are also taxed with finding an effective way to communicate 
inspection data from their office workers to their staff in the field.

When you work with Honeywell’s UAV services and data analytics &lt;[[https://aerospace.honeywell.com/uav]]&gt; team, you also have access to our Flight Designer customer portal. Simply annotate and prioritize repairs from the convenience of your office or in the field (pictured above). 

Receive the actionable analytics you need to make smart business decisions with Honeywell’s UAV inspection and data analytics services. For more information or to speak to one of our regional UAV inspection experts, please contact us below.
