Dear Honeywell Customer,

 On November 13th 2015, Honeywell Aerospace completed the sale of the SECAN legal entity, including our Gennevilliers site, to an affiliate of Quantum Capital Partners AG. 

This sale includes the Air Management System product line design (including heat exchangers and vapor cycle air conditioning systems), manufacturing and repair activities in Gennevilliers. All SECAN assets and liabilities, excluding the Vendôme Repair and Overhaul facility, have now been transferred to the new owner to support the full operation of Gennevilliers’ site activities. This includes all customer and supplier contracts. 
 
With the sale complete, your site contacts will remain the same. If you have any questions on Quality certification requirements, please contact Gilles Patry, Quality Leader, at +33140805985 or email Gilles.Patry@Honeywell.com &lt;mailto:Gilles.Patry@Honeywell.com&gt;.
