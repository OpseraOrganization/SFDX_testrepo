Now Playing: HD Videos, Sports, Phone Calls, VPN and Music Streaming: Wi-Fi That FLIES

Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Customer}}, 

We know you&apos;re disappointed with Wi-Fi on your business jet. But those days are over. Honeywell and our JetWave hardware bring you high-speed Wi-Fi similar to what you experience at home, with significantly fewer of those frustrating signal “drops.” Now you can stream movies, download music or large files, make phone calls, and much more, even over oceans.
Whether considering a new airplane or upgrading your existing one, please visit wifithatflies.com &lt;[[https://aerospace.honeywell.com/wifithatflies]]&gt; for more information and to contact a sales representative.
