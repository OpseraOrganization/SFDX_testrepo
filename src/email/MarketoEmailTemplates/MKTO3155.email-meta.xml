Dear Channel Partner,


As the FAA ADS-B Mandate is less than one year away, there is going to be high demand for Primus II ADS-B parts, exchanges and upgrades. Honeywell requests dealers issue a purchase order for each aircraft as early as possible in 2019. Purchase orders placed with Honeywell distributor, Satair, on or before June 30, 2019 with ship date on or before December 31, 2019 will be given Honeywell Sales 
Bulletin (HSB) 2019-01 &lt;[[https://pages3.honeywell.com/rs/641-QIX-912/images/2019-01%20Primus%20II%20ADS-B%20Out%20Upgrade%20for%20Business%20Aircraft%20with%20RM-855.pdf]]&gt; and HSB 2019-02 &lt;[[https://pages3.honeywell.com/rs/641-QIX-912/images/2019-02%20Primus%20II%20ADS-B%20Out%20Upgrade%20for%20Business%20Aircraft%20with%20RM-850.pdf]]&gt; pricing as applicable. 

Note: Both HSB 2019-01 and HSB 2019-02 expire June 30, 2019.

aircraft maintenance slots and resources.

To qualify for this offering, each purchase order to Satair must contain the aircraft make, model, serial number, tail number, operator / end user name and requested delivery date.</textOnly>
