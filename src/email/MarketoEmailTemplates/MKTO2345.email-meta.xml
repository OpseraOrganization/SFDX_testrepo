 In-Flight Connectivity Means Never Being Out of Touch

Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Customer}},

It’s the championship game. It’s been a historic run in the play-offs with your favorite team and you’ve been with them for every play. On the eve of the big game, you discover that you’re needed in Los Angeles and will be in the air during the game. A whole season of fandom gone with one trip.

No more. Never miss a quarter or an inning while in flight with Honeywell’s JetWave hardware and Inmarsat’s Jet ConneX service. You can watch the game LIVE while in flight, and at the same time, stay connected with your team and other fans during the game on your phone, tablet or laptop! Honeywell and Inmarsat can keep you informed, entertained and prepared while in flight.




READY TO GET CONNECTED? &lt;[[https://aerospace.honeywell.com/en/pages/Honeywell-JetWave-Provides-High-Speed-Connectivity-Globally]]&gt;</textOnly>
