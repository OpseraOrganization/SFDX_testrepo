You call Honeywell to place an order or solve a problem. And instead of just a name and number popping on the screen in front of the person taking your call, there’s a photo – of you!

That’s the scenario we’re working to create at Honeywell. In an age when just about everyone is starring in their own Instagram and selfie, we want to put that phenomenon to work for you.
Research shows that adding a picture to a customer file greatly improves the interaction between caller and company representative. It makes it more personal, and delivers the kind of customer experience we believe you deserve.
You can help us create that experience by emailing us a photo of yourself. (We suggest you send a head shot, but it’s your choice.) To take care of legal requirements, please reply to this email with the word “Approved” and attach your photo.


Rest assured – your photo will solely be uploaded into Salesforce.com, and be seen only by Honeywell employees with proper login identification. Once uploaded, we won’t share your image, or change your photo unless you ask us to.
So help us create a better customer experience for you. Send us your photo and approval. And leave it to Honeywell to always keep you lookin’ good.

We appreciate your help!
