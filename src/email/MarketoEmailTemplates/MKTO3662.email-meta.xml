    <subject>Stop Replacing DU-870 Displays with Spares!</subject>
    <textOnly>&lt;[[https://aerospace.honeywell.com/]]&gt;

Frustrated by failures and exchange costs on your DU-870 displays? Stop supporting 
your aircraft with spares that have a limited life span. Instead, improve your vision and add instant value to your aircraft by upgrading to Honeywell Primus Elite DU-875 LCD displays with Mid Canada Mod Center. Certified for Lear 40/45 and Falcon 900 EX/C aircraft, the benefits of upgrading include:



	- Updates cockpit to latest technology with a quick &quot;plug and play&quot; display
	- Removes obsolescence issue facing DU-870 CRTs 
	- Lowers your cost of operation - increases reliability by 2X and lowers weight by seven pounds per display unit
	- Brings a brighter, clearer, high resolution picture to the pilots that runs cooler and creates less heat in the cockpit
	- Operators can replace display units one at a time upon failure or all displays at once
	- Positions aircraft to later add operational features as part of Primus Elite upgrade such as electronic charts, advanced map, camera video, maintenance pages, and optional Weather XM® 
information


Plus, when you upgrade one or all of your displays you can take advantage of a limited-time $35,000 trade-in credit per DU-870 display unit (no limit). This trade in offer is 
only good through 6/30/19 so don’t delay.
