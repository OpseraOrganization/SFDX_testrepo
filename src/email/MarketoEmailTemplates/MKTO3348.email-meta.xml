Honeywell has teamed up with Constant Aviation, a Honeywell Authorized Dealer, to help Gulfstream, Global Express, Challenger and Falcon operators mitigate and/or avoid negative impacts of potential equipment failure of their obsolete SD-600 Satellite Data Unit.

While inherently reliable, should the SD-600 fail, it cannot be repaired or exchanged! Plus you will not be able to operate in FANS 1/A airspace. Operators are encouraged to upgrade their obsolete MCS 3000/6000 systems with SD-700 and at the same time, upgrade to Inmarsat Swiftbroadband.  Inmarsat’s Swiftbroadband service provides high-speed connections up to 400 kbps faster and offers passengers a means to “stay connected” from the moment they board the aircraft until they deplane.
And, thanks to a 2018 tax code change that allows U.S. based aircraft owners using their aircraft for business purposes to write off 100% of the upgrade costs in the first year, there has never been a better time than now to upgrade. 
Contact Constant Aviation today to learn more about this upgrade or to request a quote.
