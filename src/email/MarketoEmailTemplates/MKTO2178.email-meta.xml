Let FMS 6.1 take you to New Heights
Dear Customer,


ExecuJet South Africa, in conjunction with Honeywell, is pleased to announce the availability of the latest FMS 6.1 software upgrade for the FMZ-2000 Flight Management System. 
The software upgrade delivers significant operational benefits including access to more airports, increased safety and reduced crew workload, whilst also meeting the latest regulatory compliance and airspace requirements.
Operators may also want to consider performing their FMS 6.1 software upgrade and the mandated ADS-B Out upgrade at the same time. Both functionalities require the same upgraded WAAS Receivers when selecting the WAAS-LPV FMS 6.1 option thus enabling the operator to stay ahead of changes – preventing missed trips, delayed trips and denied access to airspace.

We also recommend the upgrade to FMZ-2000 version 6.1 as operators who have not upgraded will see a 20% increase in Navigation Database pricing from 2018. To avoid higher Navigation Database prices, operators should place their orders for software upgrades with ExecuJet South Africa or any Honeywell authorized channel partner. Navigation Database prices will continue to escalate in subsequent years on these older software versions.
