When flying, you want to have a reliable display that won’t fail.

With the DU-875 LCD display, upgrading your obsolete CRT DU-870 displays is easy! The DU-875 display is a “plug and play” solution, minimizing downtime with one-day installations. Once you upgrade, experience several benefits including lower operational costs, high resolution images and longer life expectancy compared to CRTs.  

Right now, Honeywell is offering a $35,000 trade-in credit per display plus additional Honeywell Maintenance Service Plan incentives when you upgrade by June 30th. 

Don’t risk operations disruptions due to a CRT failure. Upgrade your displays one at a time or all at once with Pentastar Aviation!
