    <subject>Quality protection &amp; predictable maintenance costs for your HTF Nacelle</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi {{lead.First Name:default=edit me}},

 As a long-standing customer of our Maintenance Service Plan (MSP) Engine program, we appreciate your business and support over the years. In December 2020, Honeywell launched the MSP Nacelle program for Bombardier Challenger 300/350 operators with a HTF7XYZ engine. 

Bombardier Challenger 300/350 operators can now benefit from additional maintenance coverage for the nacelle system to reduce downtime, limit unexpected repair costs and gain control over maintenance needs and budgets. MSP HTF Nacelle comes packed with features that include routine inspections, treatment and repair of corrosion, and/or replacement of nacelle components when Beyond Economic Repair (BER).

 Please do not hesitate to reach out if you would like to learn more information or schedule a meeting with an MSP Sales Manager.
