To further emphasize the urgent need for compliance with the 2020 mandates, in October 2018 the FAA re-issued the ADS-B rebate program. The $500 rebate is offered to eligible owners of fixed-wing, single engine piston aircraft based on the purchase of avionics that have received an ADS-B Technical Standard Order Authorization and meet ADS-B Out rule requirements. The program will remain in place through October 11, 2019 or when all available rebates have been claimed. Rebate reservations can only be made within 90 days of installation.

Additionally, the U.S. tax code states that the purchase price of a component retrofit/upgrade by a company can be written off 100% against its earnings.
