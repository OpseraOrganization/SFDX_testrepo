SERVICE YOUR T53 ENGINES IN REGION
Dear Customer

For over 50 years, Honeywell’s T53 turboshaft engine has been powering some of the world’s most iconic helicopters, including the Bell UH-1H Huey, Huey II and AH-1H Cobra. In that time, the engine has accumulated more than 62 million flight hours.

We&apos;re delighted to announce that Jordanian Aeronautical-systems Co. (JAC) have been appointed as the first authorized T53 engine service center in the Middle East and Africa region. The agreement recognizes the needs of Honeywell’s T53 customers by offering both military and commerical operators a more accessible, regional repair and maintenance option, meaning quicker turnaround and less downtime so you can keep your aircraft mission ready.

Please contact us to learn more or schedule service.
