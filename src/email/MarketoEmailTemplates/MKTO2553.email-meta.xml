 Honeywell GoDirect Customer Advisory Board Meeting in Phoenix, AZ
&lt;[[https://aerospace.honeywell.com/en/products/safety-and-connectivity/jetwave-high-speed-satellite-communications-hardware]]&gt;
Hello GoDirect Customer Advisory Board Member, 


I cannot believe it is April already. Since our last board meeting, the Honeywell GoDirect team has been busy designing, developing and releasing software, applications and hardware based on your feedback. We are just getting started and have revised roadmaps and demonstrations to share with you as well as a “Huuuge” list of questions to get your valuable input. We will have a packed agenda again and hope you can make the meeting. Based on the group’s feedback, we are scheduling the next meeting in June. 
Where: Honeywell Phoenix Sky Harbor Office
(We will need access to the lab environment for demonstrations.) 


When:
• Tuesday, June 12 – Welcome Cocktail Reception 
• Wednesday, June 13 – Meeting and Dinner 
• Thursday, June 14 – Meeting (ends at noon) 


Please RSVP by Friday, April 13 so we can make appropriate hotel arrangements.
