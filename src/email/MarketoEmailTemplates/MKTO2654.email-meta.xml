We offer satcom hardware solutions for fixed and rotory wing applications that connect to both Iridium and Inmarsat L-band and Ka-band networks, as well as our GoDirectTM airtime services, tools and routers – designed to enable you to take control of the network and the costs associated. We also provide a broad portfolio of connected services which deliver reductions in cost, downtime and unscheduled maintenance events.  Our breadth of capability means we are uniquely placed to customize the right solution for your mission requirements, as well as your budget.
