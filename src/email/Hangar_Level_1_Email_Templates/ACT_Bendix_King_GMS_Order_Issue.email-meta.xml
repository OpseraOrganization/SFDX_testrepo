    <textOnly>Dear {!Case.Contact},

My name is {!Case.OwnerFirstName} and I am working on your Bendix King submission. Due to a systematic issue on our web portal, it is unclear if you wished to place an order or were requesting price and lead time information only. Due to this uncertainty, I am providing you with pricing and lead time details so you can submit your order request by email while our portal updates are in process.

If you would like to place an order for these items, please send an email to orders@honeywell.com with your purchase order attached so we can process your order as quickly as possible. We expect this to be resolved very quickly so your future orders will process correctly on the myaerospace.com web portal.


Sincerely,
{!Case.OwnerFirstName} 
Honeywell Aerospace Order Support Team</textOnly>
