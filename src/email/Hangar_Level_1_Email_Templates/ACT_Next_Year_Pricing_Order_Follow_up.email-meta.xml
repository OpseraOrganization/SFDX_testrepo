Related to your purchase order XXXX, Honeywell sales order XXXXXXX has been created to secure your reservation for this requirement.

Due to delivery year pricing and/or your contract pricing either not being finalized or uploaded in our system, delivery year pricing is not yet available. We are acknowledging your order with exception under Honeywell Terms and Conditions specifying that items are priced in the year of scheduled delivery.


If your contract for the following year has already been agreed and your purchase order is aligned to this, no further action will be required.


If there is a discrepancy when pricing is finalized, we will contact you to provide a revised purchase order. You will need to provide the revised purchase order within 7 business days or we may cancel this reservation.
