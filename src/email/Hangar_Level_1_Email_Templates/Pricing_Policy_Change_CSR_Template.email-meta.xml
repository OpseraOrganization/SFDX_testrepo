    <textOnly>Dear Customer,

Honeywell has made a business decision to update our early shipment terms effective January 1, 2019. Spares orders not on contract will be priced based on the date the order/line is accepted and may be shipped as soon as material is available, potentially ahead of your request date. If you wish to avoid the early ship ahead terms in the future, contact your Customer Business Manager to establish a contract with negotiated terms.
