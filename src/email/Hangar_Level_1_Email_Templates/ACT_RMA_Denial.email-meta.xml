    <textOnly>Dear Honeywell Customer,

Thank you for contacting Honeywell Aerospace Customer Support. 

Our returns management team has completed a final review of your return material authorization request.

Based on the review, we regret to inform you that we are unable to approve your request because it doesn’t fit within the parameters of the Honeywell return policies.

This return material request has been declined based on one or more of the following reason(s):

Request was received beyond the 30 day time requirement.

For Honeywell administrative errors (incorrect part number, incorrect quantity, duplicated order, shipped to incorrect location, missing documentation, order canceled), the product must be received at Honeywell within 30 days of the approved RMA issue date.

Administrative error not caused by Honeywell.

The RMA has been canceled. The product will be returned to you on (insert date)  via AWB #  (insert air waybill details).

Once again, I’d like to apologize for any inconvenience that this may have caused you.
