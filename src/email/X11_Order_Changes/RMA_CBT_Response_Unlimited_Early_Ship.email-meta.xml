    <subject>Response to CBT - Unlimited early ship</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear Customer Business Manager,

Honeywell has updated 2019 conditions of sale where product may be shipped when material is available, potentially before customer requested delivery date.

If you wish to avoid the unlimited early ship ahead policy for this customer, you can establish a contract. After you have established contractual early ship ahead days, send the contract details to Donna.Amelia@honeywell.com and she will load the customer/ plant/ distribution center/ sales org sequence in the SAP early ship ahead table.

Case Number: &lt;Enter Customer CASE#&gt;
Purchase Order Number: &lt;Enter Customer PO#&gt;
Sales Order Number: &lt;Enter SAP SO#&gt;
