    <subject>Order Quantity Decrease Request – Outside-of-policy – INTERNAL only {!Case.Subject} {!Case.CaseNumber}, {!Case.Case_Ref_ID__c}</subject>
    <textOnly>We are unable to complete your order line quantity decrease request as it falls outside the order change policy. Order line quantities can be decreased/ modified if the request is made within 7 calendar days of order placement and the line item is not in delivery status and there is no violation of minimum order quantities.

Case Number: {!Case.CaseNumber}
PO Number: &lt;Enter Customer PO#&gt;
Sales Order Number: &lt;Enter SAP SO#&gt;

If you still require an order line quantity decrease that is outside of policy, an approval is required to override the policy. The approval required is as follows:

If order change is &lt; $1,000,0000, approval should be granted by the Gold Business Enterprise Product SBU Vice President associated with the part number on order.
If order change is $1,000,000+, approval should be granted by the Product SBU President associated with the part number on order.

Please send an email to the approver with justification as to why the quantity decrease should be allowed outside of policy. Once the approval is received, please reply to this email attaching the approval so it can be processed.
