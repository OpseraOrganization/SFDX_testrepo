    <textOnly>Dear Honeywell Colleague,

We are unable to cancel this request as it falls outside our order cancellation window of 7 calendar days from order placement.

You can either request the Customer to pay the applicable cancellation fee or you can provide an ACAT number to cover the cost of either the cancellation fee or the full invoice of the order line item. The cancellation fee equals the full line item net value if the order line is Make-to-order (MTO) part, a custom part of a part that can only be sold to certain customers. Otherwise, the cancellation fee = 15% of the line item net value.

Case Number: {!Case.CaseNumber}
PO Number: &lt;Enter Customer PO#&gt;
Sales Order Number: &lt;Enter SAP SO#&gt;

While we wait for your response, this order and SFDC case will be put on an SBU owned hold and the case will be transferred to the RMA Cancellation team.

Please respond to this email with either an approved ACAT number or a confirmation that a cancellation fee should be applied to the Customer’s account.

Note: if the ACAT is not filed within (7) calendar days, this case will be automatically closed and the customer will be charged the cancellation fee.
