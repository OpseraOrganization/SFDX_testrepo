Dear {!Case.Contact},

Your request for quote  has reached Ground Support Solutions.  All quote requests are screened to determine entitlement to purchase ground support equipment.  It is the policy of Honeywell to limit distribution of maintenance materials to only direct users of the supported prime equipment.  We are unable to provide a quote to Companies that are not licensed by Honeywell.

If you have a Honeywell license agreement that we are unaware of, please advise and we will be happy to review.

Thank you,

Honeywell Aerospace
