    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

In order to support the environment, Honeywell Technical Publications is encouraging our customers to participate in the Go Green initiative. Please refer to the Word Document for more information about the project. We are attaching a list of all the documents that your company receives currently. Please reply to this email to confirm if you agree to convert  from paper to 100% web-based electronic email. This will be the case unless the document is an export restricted item in which it will be delivered to you in paper format. If your company rather not participate, please let us know and we will remove your name. Please note that if there are multiple contacts within your company that receive paper copies, we are asking you to work with them to make sure that they agree to Go Green as well.

If you do agree to convert , please be advised that there may be some orders/updates that have previously been processed and awaiting shipment that have not yet been converted. This will be resolved
when any future orders/updates are sent. If you have any comments or questions, feel free to contact us at GoGreen@Honeywell.com.

Please confirm that we may proceed with converting your company to &quot;Go Green&quot;.

Thank you,

C&amp;PS Go Green Project Team</textOnly>
