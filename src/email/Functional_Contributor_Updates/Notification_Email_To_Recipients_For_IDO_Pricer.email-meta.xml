Price agreement on the Honeywell {!Functional_Contributor_Update__c.Opportunity_Proposal_Name__c} {!Functional_Contributor_Update__c.Opportunity_Proposal_Description__c} (Site: {!Functional_Contributor_Update__c.Lead_Site__c}) was reached on {!Functional_Contributor_Update__c.Opportunity_Proposal_Negotiation_Complet__c} with {!Functional_Contributor_Update__c.Opportunity_Proposal_Customer__c}.



Honeywell must sign a Certification of Current Cost and Pricing Data certifying to the customer that the cost and pricing data from which the settlement price was obtained were accurate, complete and current as of the date that {!Functional_Contributor_Update__c.Opportunity_Proposal_Customer__c} and Honeywell agreed on a price.



As a Functional Contributor you play an important role in determining Current Cost and Pricing Data. As such please review the IDO proposal you submitted in support of this effort and provide a TINA certification package if your cost through G&amp;A is in excess of $700K.  If your cost is below $700K, please provide all updated cost and pricing data as of this agreement date.  If your input is commercial, please advise if any additional data needs to be provided for the TINA Certification package.



Please provide all data found as a result of this review to {!Functional_Contributor_Update__c.Opportunity_Proposal_Pricing_Analyst__c} and reply no later than {!Functional_Contributor_Update__c.X2_Days_from_requested_date__c}.

“Cost or Pricing Data” (FAR 15.406-2 in accordance with definitions contained in 2.101) means all facts as of the date of price agreement, or, if applicable, an earlier date agreed upon between the parties that is as close as practicable to the date of agreement on price, that prudent buyers and sellers would reasonably expect to affect price negotiations significantly.  Cost or pricing data are factual, not judgmental; and are verifiable.  While they do not indicate the accuracy of the prospective contractor’s judgment about future costs or projections, they do include the data forming the basis for that judgment.  Cost or pricing data are more than historical accounting data; they are all the facts that can be reasonably expected to contribute to the soundness of estimates of future costs and to the validity of determinations of costs already incurred.</textOnly>
