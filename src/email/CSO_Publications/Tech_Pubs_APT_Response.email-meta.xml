    <subject>Your Honeywell Tech Pubs Request {!Case.CaseNumber}</subject>
    <textOnly>Hello {!Contact.FirstName},



Thank you for contacting the Honeywell Aerospace Technical Publications Team with your request for technical publications.



In response to customer feedback, Honeywell has established a new method for Management Services Companies (MSC) to access Honeywell Technical Publications. In order to simplify the access and the renewal process to Honeywell Technical Publications, MSC’s have the option to enter into a royalty bearing License Agreement with our partner Aircraft Technical Publishers (ATP).



Under the License Agreement, MSCs are required to report, annually and up-front, all of the aircraft under management with Honeywell Products and pay respective royalty fees to access Technical Publications. The royalty fee is based on the Honeywell equipment on-board each aircraft platform and the number of owners of the aircraft under management by the MSC.  MSCs will disclose fleet details of aircraft under their management through an annual royalty report which is subject to audit under the terms of the License Agreement.



The MSC will have access to all current revisions of Honeywell Technical Publications. MSCs will have rights to perform line maintenance tasks on Honeywell Avionics, Engines and APUs for all of the aircraft under management as documented in the annual report. Technical Publications included are the same Level 1 and Level 2 Technical Publications that the Owners/Operators of the aircraft are entitled to purchase.


Typically the following Technical Publications are included if available:



• Maintenance Manuals (MM)

• Illustrated Parts Catalogs(IPC)

• System Description and Operating Manuals(SDOM)


Next Steps

In order to best serve you and assist you we have forwarded your information to ATP who will assist you with this request. Should you have any questions regarding the MSC process please contact Joe Miraglia with ATP at 1.415.330.3701 or JMiraglia@ATP.com.
