    <textOnly>Hello {!Contact.FirstName},

Thank you for contacting the Honeywell Aerospace Technical Publications Team on {!Case.Order_Entered__c} with your request for technical publications:

Unfortunately, we’re not able to fulfill your request. The technical data you asked for is limited to customers who’ve purchased the applicable tooling directly from Honeywell.



If you believe that we’re mistaken, and you did purchase the applicable tooling to qualify for access to these publications, please let us know, and we’ll launch a review to double-check.

For Case Related Questions?

We’ll connect all of your inquiry details through the subject line of this email. So, should you reply, please leave the subject line unchanged to make sure your response is routed immediately to this case.
