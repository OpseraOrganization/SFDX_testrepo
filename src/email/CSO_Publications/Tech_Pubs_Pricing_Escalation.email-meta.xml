    <textOnly>Hello {!Contact.FirstName},



Thank you for contacting the Honeywell Aerospace Technical Publications Team with your request for technical publications.



Honeywell has made the strategic business decision to charge what they have determined to be a fair market value for the use of their Intellectual Property (IP). We understand that the pricing may seem extreme, but please keep in mind that Honeywell avidly protects their IP and charges for the information contained within the manuals. If you have any additional questions or concerns regarding our pricing structure please contact your CSM/CBM.



Visit the MyAerospace portal and get the latest revision status and dates on all your Honeywell technical publications.
