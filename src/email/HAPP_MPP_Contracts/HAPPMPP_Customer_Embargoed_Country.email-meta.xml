    <textOnly>Dear Valued Customer,

Our Honeywell HAPP/MPP contracts department has previously sent you several ANNUAL billing notices to continue the enrollment for your aircraft (AIRCRAFT DETAILS). The last notification was on (DATE SENT).  As of today, we have not received a valid purchase order (PO) or authorization to bill from you.


Please note your annual contract term expired on (August 1, 2013) and your coverage has been suspended as of that date.


To retroactively reinstate coverage we require your response with either a PO or authorization to bill you within 10 days from the date of this notice.


If we do not receive a purchase order for your annual coverage or response with a confirmation that we can bill you by this date we will assume you no longer wish to have HAPP/MPP coverage on your aircraft and we will review this contract for closure.


Please let the contracts department know if you have any further questions regarding this request. Please reply back to happ-sales@honeywell.com for processing.


Best Regards,
{!Case.OwnerFirstName}

HAPP Administration
