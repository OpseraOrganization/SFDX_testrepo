    <textOnly>Dear {!Case.Contact},


Our Honeywell MSP transfer department had sent you a transfer package to complete for your aircraft on {!Today() - 90}, and as of today, we have not received this completed paperwork back from you.  We only allow a 30 day interim coverage upon transfer of the MSP contract, and it now has been almost three months since you took possession of the aircraft.


Please sign and email the contract back to our transfer department at mspcontracts@honeywell.com by {!Today() + 7}, so we can finish this transfer process.  If we do not receive the signed contracts back by this date we will assume you no longer wish to have MSP coverage on your aircraft and we will review this contract for closure.  Once closed, should you wish to have MSP coverage on this aircraft in the future, we will then require a full buy-in to return to the program.  Please let the transfer department know if you have any further questions regarding this request.


Thank you for your help.
