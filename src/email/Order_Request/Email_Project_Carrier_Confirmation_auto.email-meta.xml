    <textOnly>Order Confirmation – Missing Carrier Information



Good News!

Your Honeywell order is almost ready to go.

Order Summary:

Purchase Order#: {!Case.Customer_PO_RO_WONumber__c}
Sales Order#: {!Case.Sales_Order_Number__c}

But before we can get it out to you, we need help with your carrier/shipping account number. The information we have on file appears to be missing or out of date.

So please email or call with your updated carrier number right away – preferably at least 10 calendar days before the estimated ship date listed below. If we don’t have your information by then, we’ll need to invoice you for any pre-paid transportation charges.

Estimated Ship Date: {!Case.Estimated_Ship_Date__c}

Questions?

We’ll connect all of your order details through the subject line of this email. So please leave the subject line unchanged, should you reply, to make sure your response is routed immediately to this team.

Thanks again, we appreciate your business!
