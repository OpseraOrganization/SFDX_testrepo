We have identified that this order requires an Export License for part number(s) &lt;Enter PN here&gt;.

If a valid export authorization is already in place, your order will be scheduled to ship to your requested delivery schedule or defined lead-time where applicable.

The US export license process takes approximately 12 weeks, if there is not an existing export authorization that covers the identified item(s) we will move your request date to 12 weeks from order placement if your request date is less than 12 weeks. We will not change the order date if your requested delivery is equal to or greater than 12 weeks or if a valid export authorization applies.

Please populate and return the attached Export License Questionnaire and End User Certification. To prevent this item from being cancelled, please prioritize the completion and return of these items within 10 days.

Please note that China customers may need a MOFCOM certificate and Hong Kong customers may need a Hong Kong Import License that must be provided to Honeywell prior to shipment. If needed, please start the process quickly to avoid affecting your delivery. Delays in submittal to Honeywell may result in delivery date delays.
