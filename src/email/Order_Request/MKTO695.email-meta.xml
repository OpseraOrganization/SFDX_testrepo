    <textOnly>ELT Order – We Need Your Coding Sheet


Hello {!Case.Contact_Name__c},

We&apos;re glad to hear from you! We’ve received your ELT order {!Case.CaseNumber}, and are anxious to get right to work on it.

But before we can start, we need your help. We need just a bit more information to complete your request. Your ELT coding sheet.

Submitting your ELT coding sheet is super easy with the new online form. Just log into the MyAerospace portal and select the software &amp; database tab.

Accessing the new form does require a MyAerospace portal ID. Don’t have an ID? No problem! Just go to the portal and sign up as a new user and then request access to the ASDS web page.

We’ve decommissioned the old email method. So starting now, you’ll need to begin using this new form.

Need more information or help in updating your ELT? Call us at +1-602-436-6737, option 5, or click on DSA@Honeywell.com.

Thank you. We appreciate your business!

Honeywell Aerospace Customer Support
