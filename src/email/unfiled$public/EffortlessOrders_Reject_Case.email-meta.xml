Thank you for submitting your order through MyAerospace. Unfortunately we were unable to process your order because the information described below was not included. Please forward this email to orders@honeywell.com including the referenced information so that we can process your order.

The quickest, easiest way to remedy the problem is to send us a new purchase order with all the blanks filled.

Here’s the additional information we need:
