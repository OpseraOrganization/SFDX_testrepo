    <textOnly>Dear Customer,


Thanks for placing an order with Honeywell Aerospace.

As we were reviewing your request, we noticed that your account requires payment prior to us entering the order.

We’d like to begin working on your order today!  So please refer to the attached invoice when submitting your payment. We’ve included our bank information right on the invoice so you can easily pay via wire transfer.

We’d hate to see you go, but if we have not heard from you within the next 10 days, we’ll need to cancel your order.  So please send us your payment details as soon as you can.

If you have any questions or concerns regarding the order, please reply to this message. We’ve connected all of your order details through the subject line of this email. That subject line was created specifically for you and is unique to this order.

In the mean time, while you’re processing the payment, we’ll add 11 days to your original request date. When you accept and make payment, don’t forget to update your own internal systems so that they match this request date modification.

10 calendar days. That’s the total amount of time you have to provide payment for this order.  After that timeframe, your order will expire. So don’t delay!  We’re anxious to get started on your order.


Thank you for your interest in our products!  We’re on the lookout for your reply!


Best Regards,


Honeywell Aerospace Order Support</textOnly>
