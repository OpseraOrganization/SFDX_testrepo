    <textOnly>Order Request


Hello {!Case.Contact},

We’re glad to hear from you, and we’re ready to go to work for you.

There’ve been some changes to the Honeywell customer ordering process since you were here last. Now, instead of emailing your request, you’ll log onto myaerospace.com, and simply follow the prompts to place your order.

Why the change? It’s because this new system moves your request from ordered to filled to delivered faster than any email system ever could. The web portal gives you instant, written confirmation that your order has been placed and is being processed. And it allows you to check and track its progress from any computer or smartphone. In fact, you can track the status of any order through MyAerospace.com as well as request price &amp; availability.

It’s important that you understand that in shifting to this new streamlined process Honeywell has completely disabled our email ordering system. So please, log onto MyAerospace.com and resubmit your order.

We appreciate you taking this one-time extra step to order. Rest assured, from now on out the portal will open a world of convenience, access, dependability, and speed for your company.

Thank you. We appreciate your business!
