Hello {!Case.Contact},

We’re glad to hear from you!

There’ve been some changes to the Honeywell customer ordering process since you were here last. Now, instead of emailing for order status updates, you’ll log onto myaerospace.com, and simply follow the prompts to check on your order.

It’s important that you understand that in shifting to this new streamlined process Honeywell has completely disabled our email status update system. So please, log onto MyAerospace.com to find the latest information on your order.

We appreciate you taking this one-time extra step. Rest assured, from now on out the portal will open a world of convenience, access, dependability, and speed for your company.

Thank you. We appreciate your business!
