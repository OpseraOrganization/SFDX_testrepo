    <textOnly>Dear Valued Customer,


This is a friendly reminder that we have not heard back from you in regards to the transfer of MSP Contract 4400XXXXX which needs to be completed by XX/XX/20XX.



There is still time for you to complete the transfer process which gives you the opportunity to continue to have your aircraft covered. Please sign your transfer contract and send it back to us for processing.



*Important note: The transfer process needs to be completed by within 90 days of the date of the initial notification otherwise the contract will be terminated. If in the future you wish reinstate MSP coverage on this aircraft, we will then require the full buy-in fee to return to the program.  Please let the MSP Sales team know if you have any further questions regarding this request.



Thank you for doing business with us, your case tracking number for this renewal is provided above. You may reply to this email - please leave the reference Case # within the subject line for quicker responses.
