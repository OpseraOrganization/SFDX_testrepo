{!Case.OwnerFullName} is calling you to action to support getting {!Case.CaseNumber} moving forward for {!Case.Account}.



Currently, the case is on {!Case.Sub_Status__c}, {!Case.Reason_for_hold__c}.



Expected Actions


Complete the action requested by the CSR shown below.

ACTION Requested: {!Case.Internal_HW_Action__c}

If it cannot be completed, please reply to this email with an estimated completion date.

If you are not the appropriate person to answer or take action, respond immediately so the request can be re-routed to the appropriate person.

If you know who the appropriate person is, please include that in your reply and include that person on the response to reduce the customer wait time.


Keep in mind - every request or question from a C&amp;PS colleague is really a request from a customer.
