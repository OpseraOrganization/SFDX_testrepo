We are pleased to announce we have expanded our HIS geographical scope to include the Asia Pacific region.<BR><BR>Over the next several months, the HIS entity will also assume responsibility for delivery of all new condition mechanical and avionics aftermarket piece parts orders currently procured from the Honeywell facility in Phoenix, Ariz. This transition only applies to supplier cage codes 7X000 for mechanical piece parts, and 58960 and 97896 for avionic piece parts.<BR><BR>Starting April 6, 2009, customers may begin ordering new condition mechanical and avionic piece parts using the HIS Cage Code SCY35. This new cage code encompasses mechanical and avionic - new condition only - spare parts. After April 6, 2009, we can no longer accept purchase orders for new condition mechanical and avionics piece parts that are placed at the Phoenix, Ariz., location using supplier cage codes 7X000, 58960 and 97896.<BR><BR>This change does NOT apply to the following items:<BR><BR>Mechanical:<BR>o Complete Engine and APU (top level) assemblies<BR>o Exchange units (APU and Engine rentals)<BR>o Repair and overhaul orders<BR>o RMA and Warranty for parts originally ordered from 7X000<BR>o ITAR restricted parts<BR>o Store front parts<BR><BR>Avionics:<BR>o LRU end items<BR>o SPEX™ (Spares Exchange)<BR>o Consigned parts<BR>o ITAR restricted parts<BR>o EAR licensed parts<BR><BR>For your reference, a detailed list of HIS non-procurable parts and the new ordering process document titled "HIS Order Entry Process for APAC Customers" are included with this letter.<BR><BR>Please note that orders against cage code SCY35 will be shipped from our HIS Distribution Center located in Hemel Hempstead, United Kingdom. For these shipments, we kindly asked that you provide a valid customer carrier account number or freight forwarder with contact details to jirina.salkova@honeywell.com, no later than February 27, 2009.<BR><BR>To make this transition process as seamless as possible, please use the following steps as a guide to help with any system changes:<BR>1. Set up new HIS cage code SCY35 in your system<BR>2. Amend purchase order address to display HIS vendor details<BR>3. Amend HIS vendor billing information<BR>4.
