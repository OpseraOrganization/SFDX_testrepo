Dear Honeywell Colleague,

I have received a customer request that I believe to fall within the Complex Problem Definition.  Please review the case details and confirm you agree.

Complex Problem Reasoning: (Descriptive reasoning of why CSR feels this is a complex problem and CSM engagement is necessary)

Should you have questions regarding the request, please use Lync to directly engage the CASE OWNER listed above or include your clarification request in the email response.

ACTION: Reply to this email choosing one of the following options:

Option 1: Yes, please cancel the case using “Case not within CSO CASE Scope” as the reason and I will take it from here.

Option 2: Yes, but please keep the case opened as I work on the issue and I will respond shortly with a resolution.

Option 3: No, please keep the case opened, this issue Does NOT fit within the Complex Problem Scope.
Thank you for your assistance,
