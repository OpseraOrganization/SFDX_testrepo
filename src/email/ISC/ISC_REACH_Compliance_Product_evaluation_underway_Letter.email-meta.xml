    <name>ISC - REACH Compliance (Product evaluation underway) Letter</name>

    <textOnly>Thank you for contacting Honeywell Aerospace Customer Support.  Your case tracking number for this inquiry is provided above.  If you wish to communicate with us further about this inquiry, you may reply to this e-mail -- please leave the Reference Case # within the subject line for quicker responses.
 
Honeywell Aerospace takes its compliance with REACH very seriously.  
As part of our ongoing compliance commitment, we are currently in the process of identifying if any substances of very high concern (SVHCs), (meeting the criteria set out in Article 57 of REACH and included on the REACH &quot;Candidate List&quot; for further regulation), are contained within the product we supply to you above a concentration of 0.1% (w/w).
 
This communication refers to the latest version of the ECHA Candidate List at the time the product was shipped.  
As part of this process we are:
·         reviewing internal or publicly available engineering data in relation to the presence of SVHCs in our products or any of their component parts;
·         reviewing available safety data sheets for all our input materials;
·         communicating with our suppliers to exclude/confirm the presence of SVHCs in any component parts of our products.
This is a challenging and wide-ranging task and therefore, until this process has been completed,  we are not presently in a position to confirm which SVHCs appearing on the Candidate List in concentrations above 0.1 % (w/w) (if any), are present in the above-mentioned product(s) we supply to you.
We will contact you again, as soon as we are able to provide you with this information and will advise you at that point of appropriate measures to allow safe use of the product in the event that any Candidate List SVHCs are identified above a concentration of 0.1% (w/w). 
Yours faithfully
