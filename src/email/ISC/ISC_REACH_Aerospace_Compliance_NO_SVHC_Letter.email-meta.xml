    <textOnly>Thank you for contacting Honeywell Aerospace Customer Support.  Your case tracking number for this inquiry is provided above.  If you wish to communicate with us further about this inquiry, you may reply to this e-mail -- please leave the Reference Case # within the subject line for quicker responses.
 
Honeywell Aerospace takes its compliance with REACH very seriously.  
As part of our ongoing compliance commitment, we have completed a process to identify which, if any, substances of very high concern (SVHCs), (meeting the criteria set out in Article 57 of REACH and included on the REACH &quot;Candidate List&quot; for further regulation), are contained within the product we supply to you and in what concentrations.
 
This communication refers to the latest version of the ECHA Candidate List at the time the product was shipped.  
As part of this SVHC identification process we have:
·         reviewed internal/publicly available engineering data in relation to the presence of SVHCs in our products or any of their component parts;
·         reviewed available safety data sheets for all our input materials;
·         communicated with our suppliers to exclude/confirm the presence of SVHCs in any component parts of our products.
As a result of this process, we confirm that the product we currently supply to you does not contain any SVHCs included on the Candidate List in concentrations above 0.1 % (w/w).
Yours faithfully

Marjorie Baumann
Director of Product Stewardship
Honeywell Aerospace
