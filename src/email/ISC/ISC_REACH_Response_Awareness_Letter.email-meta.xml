    <textOnly>Dear Customer,
 
Thank you for contacting Honeywell Aerospace Customer Support.  Your case tracking number for this inquiry is provided above.  If you wish to communicate with us further about this inquiry, you may reply to this e-mail -- please leave the Reference Case # within the subject line for quicker responses.
 
This is to inform you that Honeywell Aerospace is well aware that REACH entered into force on June 1, 2007, and also aware of the projected timetable to comply with the resulting pre-registration and registration obligations. 
 
Honeywell Aerospace is committed to meeting its legal obligations under REACH, as a manufacturer, importer or downstream user and an extensive program preparing for that is now well underway.  It is our intention to work closely with our supply chain to ensure the pre-registration and registration requirements are met for products Honeywell Aerospace has on the market in the EU. As you are aware, pre-registered substances will benefit from a phase-in status.  Depending on the volumes involved, registration may occur within the next 11 years.  We have completed our chemical inventories at the legal entities within Europe and have completed the pre-registration of those imported chemicals that meet the 1MT/yr/LE threshold requirement.
 
We are in the process of conducting product evaluations for the content of any SVHC included on the October 2008 release of the candidate list.
 
Of course, should you consider that any product Honeywell Aerospace supplies to you is a critical component in your operations, we would be happy to learn about that and to discuss the situation in more detail. 
 
Sincerely yours,

Marjorie Baumann
Director of Product Stewardship
Honeywell Aerospace
