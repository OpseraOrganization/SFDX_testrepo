    <textOnly>(Name of CBM),

Please see below information on excessively aging customer holds. I have attempted to gain a response/approval from the customer several times and have not been successful. At this point in the order hold process, I am escalating to you for help in resolving the hold and placing the order on a business owned hold in the system.
