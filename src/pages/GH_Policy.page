            In the ordinary course of business, it is often appropriate to provide certain courtesies,
            such as small gifts and reasonable meals, and even, sometimes, entertainment, lodging, or
            transportation. Nevertheless, as outlined in the Honeywell Code of Business Conduct and Anticorruption
            policy 2066, employees must take great care when doing so to avoid even the
            appearance of any conflict of interest, improper influence, bribe, favor, or kickback. Business
            courtesies that may be acceptable in a commercial setting may be unacceptable or even illegal
            when they involve government officials. In addition, failure to ensure that our customers and
            business partners conform to our compliance culture may compromise their ability to make
            objective and fair business decisions. Therefore, Honeywell employees must exercise good
            judgment and follow this policy for offering business-related gifts and hospitality. Additionally,
            under all circumstances, we must ensure that all business courtesies are properly documented in
            Honeywell’s records and supported with valid receipts.
