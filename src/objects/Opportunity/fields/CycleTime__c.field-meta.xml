    <fullName>CycleTime__c</fullName>
    <description>Number of days between Workbook and Lic to Customer dates. In our spreadsheet, if the workbook date is blank, we use PO Rcvd Date or “Critical Data Delivery date minus 40” as a ‘proxy’ for workbook date. And if the license hasn’t gone to the customer then we use the ‘End of Fiscal Qtr’ date as the Lic to Customer though in both cases the resulting number is relatively meaningless. The CycleTime is only meaningful / used for reporting AFTER the Invoice is Request i.e. we are Done.</description>
