    <description>Define the current status of SR Request:
*OPEN – Brand-new issues forwarded to Honeywell by customers.
*IN PROGRESS – Action/items being in work by Honeywell owners.
*CLOSED – Items are closed and actions finished. (The action/item is considered “closed” once its closure is approved by the committee during one of the meetings.) 
*CONTINUOUS – Ongoing action items that will never be stopped (e.g. improvement actions). Honeywell recommends to close the item once the progress is sufficient, adequate tools are created and plans to complete are in place.</description>
